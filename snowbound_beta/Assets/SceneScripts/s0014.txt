MARISA: "So that's the way it is, then? What if I told you it was all a mistake?"
ERIC: "What?"
MARISA: "What if I said that the day I led you to skip the exam, I was just as fooled as you were."
ERIC: "Except you took that test."
MARISA: "And only made it to the start of the exam at the last second, because I was trying to find you to cancel."
ERIC: "It's not that easy. I'd be stupid to be taken in by that."
MARISA: "You would be. I couldn't blame you for that."
ERIC: "Are you trying to imply that that's what really happened?"
MARISA: "No, I tricked you and I used you in the selfish pursuit of my own goal in a plan which I intended to carry out from the start."
She says this in a flat voice much different from her previous conviction.
MARISA: "Hey, I hope you all escape out to whatever there is to escape to."
ERIC: "Well that was grim."
MARISA: "Ignore me if I depress you. Why don't you head back? I'll give you the phone."
ERIC: "Thanks."
MARISA: "And I wasn't kidding before. I hope you make it out."
ERIC: "Look, why don't you come out of here? It's not healthy to stay in the dark all by yourself."
MARISA: "Thanks, but I don't care too much for my health right now."
