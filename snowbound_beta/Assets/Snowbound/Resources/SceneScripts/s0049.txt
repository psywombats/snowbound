HENRY: "Was that really all there was?"
SID: "Look, we were lucky to even find the chips. I don't know who those were even meant for. Let's just be glad we have water."
HENRY: "I know, I know. I'm not mad at you; I'm just really hungry right now. I need to think!"

The gray in the windows faded hours ago and we're left to our business in the dark. No one dares ask Henry for the exact time. He's been like this ever since he woke up. Everyone's eaten their share of the snack package Sid and I retrieved from the storage room. Well, except for Marisa of course. I wonder how she's doing.

ERIC: "How are the rest of them doing?"
Sid walks back from a table where most members of the jazz ensemble had gathered.

SID: "Mostly just very cold. I wish we had blankets or something. All the heat in here is long gone."
ERIC: "The most we can do is stick together... Or maybe more people could use those curtains in the auditorium. Maybe I'll talk to Marisa again later."
SID: "Okay. No one has much energy, and everyone's hungry. That's nothing new. Maybe it's worth searching for more food."
ERIC: "We don't have any options. Both fire doors are shut, the back stage exits are locked, and we can't get out the front because of the snow."
HENRY: "That's where you're wrong!"
SID: "You have a suggestion?"
HENRY: "We'll break the glass and tunnel our way out. It's a clear solution. Besides, whoever's out there has had three days to get us out. They can't blame us for breaking a few windows. Who's with me?"
