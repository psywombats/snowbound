MAX: "Have you seen Pete anywhere?"
REBECCA: "Not for a bit, anyway."
MAX: "Whenever he disappears for more than a few minutes, you know he's up to something."

I make another effort to spot him, but before too long, it becomes obvious.

[enter PETE C]
PETE: "Hey! Hey, I found a student!"
[exit PETE]
[enter REBECCA A]
[enter MAX B]
MAX: "Oh boy..."
REBECCA: "What did he get himself into now?"
[enter ARYA E]
But as we watch, a girl three or four years older than Pete stumbles in behind him. 
REBECCA: "She looks a mess. Who is that?"
MAX: "Arya Martin, I think. It's hard to tell."
REBECCA: "Who's that?"
MAX: "Captain and founder and president for life of the robotics team."
REBECCA: "We have a robotics team? And it has a president or...?"
MAX: "She's the only member, genius. No idea what she's doing here though."
I follow Max as he makes his way over to Stephen, Arya, and the rejoicing Pete.

[enter STEPHEN A]
[enter ARYA B]
STEPHEN: "The south stairwell?"
ARYA: "I was down in the physics lab the whole time. But when the lights went out I didn't have a clue what was going on."
[exit STEPHEN]
[enter PETE E]
PETE: "See? I wasn't lying."
[exit PETE]
[enter STEPHEN E]
ARYA: "I think I would've gone insane if this little dude hadn't opened the stairway door when he did. Thanks, man."
[exit STEPHEN]
[enter PETE E]
PETE: "No problem!"
[exit PETE]
[enter STEPHEN E]
ARYA: "Yeah, I set up a bit of a camp at the basement landing on the south stairs, so when I heard someone open the fire door on the first floor, I ran upstairs and practically knocked this guy over trying to get out."
STEPHEN: "That's right... So, you ran out on your own again, Pete. What for?"
[exit STEPHEN]
[enter PETE E]
Pete shrugs.
[exit PETE]
[enter STEPHEN E]
STEPHEN: "I'll let it slide. Arya, you come with me. In a little while I'll probably want a full debriefing, but for now, I'll trust you."
[exit ARYA]
[exit STEPHEN]
He makes it sound like he's doing her some huge favor.
MAX: "I'm going to go see Arya."
REBECCA: "I'm exhausted. Catch you later, then."

I don't think I can deal with much more Pete today. After I collapse next to Sophie, I can still hear him squealing all across the gym. Sophie sits up when I arrive, but she sits and stares a bit before she speaks.

[enter SOPHIE B]
[enter REBECCA D]
SOPHIE: "I'm glad Arya's safe."
REBECCA: "I am as well. What've you been up to today?"
SOPHIE: "Me? Nothing, really. Has there been anything to do?"
Now that I think of it, I've been one of the only ones spending my time running all over the place. Sophie's stayed here pretty much constantly since she arrived from the pool last night.
REBECCA: "I guess you're right. Anyway, I'm beat. Let me know if you see Max, okay?"
SOPHIE: "Alright."
