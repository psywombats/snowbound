ERIC: "Pete's right. Let's go see how the snow's coming along in the gym and then I can demo the equipment. We'll go over schedule and all that stuff at the end."
PETE: "Bye!"
[exit PETE]
CAIT: "Where do you think you're going? Stop running everywhere!"
[exit CAIT]
I guess they're both off to the gym.
REBECCA: "Do you know either of them?"
LAURA: "No, not really. I don't think I've met you either."
MAX: "I'm Maximilian Wolf, but my friends call me Maximilian. And this charming young lady - "
REBECCA: "- can introduce herself. I'm Rebecca Bell. You should stick around. We're actually not too bad when you get to know us. Even Cait, I think."
MAX: "Speaking of Cait and Pete, let's hurry to the gym before they kill each other."
[exit MAX]
ERIC: "Right."

At first I wonder why the track team members are all standing in place instead of jogging around the gym. Then I notice the windows. Through the glass panes at the top of the room, there is only a dusty white whirl. The lamps that light the way to the dorms are completely obscured.

[enter REBECCA E]
CAIT: "Is it snowing out there or is the wind just whipping it around?"
LAURA: "It's a blizzard."
REBECCA: "I thought that wasn't supposed to pick up for another few hours at least."
[exit REBECCA]
[enter ERIC A]
ERIC: "Let's get down to business, then. I don't want to have to trek through two feet of snow to get back to the dorms."
The storage closet is already open and the hurdles for the track team spread across the floor.
CAIT: "What the hell are all these sleeping bags doing in here?"
[enter MAX E]
MAX: "It's the supplies for the research methods class. We're going on an expedition next week, weather permitting."
LAURA: "That always seemed like such a dangerous class..."
[exit CAIT]
[enter PETE B]
PETE: "Finally, here they are! Swords!"
He grabs a foil out from under the fencing masks.
ERIC: "Hang on a second, we need the pads first."
MAX: "Lighten up a bit. Hey, Pete! Catch this! It straps in the back."

After a while, it becomes clear that I'm not really needed. Max and Rebecca both know the routine better than I do, and they're much better at explaining it to the newcomers. Maybe this isn't such a bad thing. On impulse, I decide to check up on Sid. Jazz ensemble usually practices in the auditorium, right?

[enter LAURA B]
[enter ERIC D]
LAURA: "Are you going somewhere?"
ERIC: "I want to see the jazz rehearsal, but I'll be back in a few minutes. Stick with Rebecca and Max."
LAURA: "No, I'll come with you. I'm sort of looking around for groups, and maybe jazz is for me."
ERIC: "So you can't decide if you want to be a jazz musician or a fencer..."
LAURA: "If your friend can do both, why can't I?"
ERIC: "Fine, you can come if you want."
