REBECCA: "Sophie's probably down there now doing the best she can for Pete, so why don't we try to keep the rest of the students from going downstairs?"
KENNETH: "I guess you're right."

One or two more students are a few feet behind Kenneth, trying to get a look past me. It doesn't take much effort from Kenneth to convince them to clear off. I'm trying to decide whether or not to stand guard at the fire door when I hear a set of footsteps.

KENNETH: "Can you see who that is?"
REBECCA: "No. You stay here."

STEPHEN: "Rebecca?"
