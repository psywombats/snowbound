SOPHIE: "Rebecca, is that you?"
REBECCA: "Sophie, you scared the hell out of me. Go down to the basements and find Max and Stephen. They need you."
KENNETH: "What's going on?"
REBECCA: "Sophie, Pete's hurt, and it's bad. Just get going, okay?"

I almost have to push her down the stairs, but instead of following her, I stay to face Kenneth.
KENNETH: "Where's Stephen? What happened?"
REBECCA: "Ken, hold on a second. Max, Stephen, Arya and I went downstairs after we heard a scream. Pete's down there and he's bleeding all over the place. Someone must've stabbed him."
KENNETH: "Is he dead?"
REBECCA: "He was alive when I was there."
I don't mention that I have no idea if he's still holding on. Kenneth looks to be about ready to topple over already.
KENNETH: "That's horrible... I can't believe anyone would do this to him. Did you see who did it?"
REBECCA: "We were there too late to see anyone."
KENNETH: "But do you know who hurt him?"

I have to pause. There's really only one suspect in my mind, but I have no proof, and even if I did, would I really want to turn her in like this? If I had seen Cait at the scene, I think I would've had to tell someone, but I'll let this situation play itself out.
