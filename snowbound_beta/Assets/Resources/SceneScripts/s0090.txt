REBECCA: "Yeah, you're right. I'll stay here."
SOPHIE: "Maybe someone else will fetch them..."

We find our way back to the spot where I was originally camped out with Max. I don't know where he ran off to, but Sophie and I make use of the space. Most of the other swim team members have calmed down by now, and the gym is starting to quiet. Pete isn't yelling all over the place any more, and the only voice that stands out is Shibin's, barking at some other student. The hush only lasts for a few minutes before Pete bursts in again.

SOPHIE: "What's that all about?"
REBECCA: "I can't tell. What's he running around with?"
[enter PETE D]
PETE: "Hi! You're a swim girl, right?"
SOPHIE: "Yes, I'm Sophie Morrigan. What do you need?"
PETE: "Is one of these yours?"
He lays out five or six backpacks.
SOPHIE: "You went to get them? Thank you."
PETE: "No problem, just doing my duty."

It takes a few minutes for Sophie to find her possessions in the dark, but once she pulls out her backpack, Pete scampers away, off to find the next girl. I don't know where he gets his energy. When Sophie leaves to change out of her swimsuit, I spend my time with my eyes following Pete. It's hard to tell if he's amusing himself, making a grab for attention, or legitimately trying to help. By the time he's done, Sophie is back. We both lie down and stare at the ceiling, lit only by the glow of some laptop open in a dim corner of the gym.
