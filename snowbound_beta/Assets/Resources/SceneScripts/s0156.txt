ERIC: "She's through?"
REBECCA: "Max took her. They're bringing her straight to Sophie."
ERIC: "That's the best news I've heard in a while."
REBECCA: "It's a shame Max couldn't stay to chat, though. He said he'll be back tomorrow night. Maybe that's when we should talk to him about trying to come back above ground."
ERIC: "Should we head back to the lounge?"
REBECCA: "Sure. I don't think I'll be able to sleep, so let's go through what Max gave us and work out what we should do tomorrow."

The bag Max gave us is packed. There are four cans of pears in here as well as two water bottles. What surprises me is that Max also included a pack of playing cards, several pens, and for some reason known only to him, seven pairs of shoelaces.

ERIC: "Shoelaces? Is that a joke?"
REBECCA: "How should I know?"
ERIC: "Where did he even get them?"
REBECCA: "Maybe he thinks they're survival material or something. It remains a mystery."
SID: "Are these the supplies?"
ERIC: "Yep. I don't know about you, but I'm hungry."

CAIT: "Did you say you've got food?"
ERIC: Four cans of pears. What do you say we open one or two of them tonight?"

Of course no one objects. By the light of a candle, we enjoy the canned fruit. Any other day I probably would've thought the pears disgusting, but tonight it's almost a gourmet meal. We're all in good spirits on the news that Laura is safe and we can eat for a few more days, and even Cait seems to be back to normalcy. As we've already lit the candle, we stay up a little longer and talk about anything but the snow.
