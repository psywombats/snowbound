When I wake up, the first thing I notice is the empty chair across from me, a blanket thrown over the back. And I remember someone sitting there last night... I take a headcount in the near dark. Where's Caitlyn? Woke up early? I was going to stay here and sleep a while longer, but as it is, I'm stiff and cold and moving around would help both of these problems. Hm, what to do...
