ERIC: "Back to the auditorium then?"
SID: "Why don't we prop this door open? It might brighten it up a little."
ERIC: "If you say so. It's not like it's much darker in there than it is in here."

Sid and I set off looking for anything that could be used as a doorstop. We each drag a chair from the tables over to the doors and open up the entrance to the auditorium.

HENRY: "So you finally decided to help out, huh?"
ERIC: "Maybe. What are you even trying to do? Don't you remember? Those side doors are locked after classes finish."
HENRY: "Damn it anyway."
I grimace at the clatter and crashing sound from somewhere on stage.
HENRY: "All right, I'm coming out. This is useless. I'll try opening the main door again."
SID: "Isn't Marisa in there?"
HENRY: "Who? Oh, that girl? I don't know where she went."
Strange. There are enough problems right now for me to be worrying about Marisa though.

HENRY: "Whose idea was it to put all of these chairs here?"
He finally becomes visible, framed between the two doors. We make our way out of the auditorium.

ERIC: "Well, you made it out alive."
HENRY: "Cut the sarcasm. Who has a watch? What time is it?"
SID: "You have one..."
HENRY: "What? Oh, right. How is it this late already? And what are we supposed to do in the dark?"
ERIC: "I haven't thought that far ahead."
SID: "Well, our light sources are limited."
ERIC: "Hey!"
I call out to the ensemble members I barely know.
ERIC: "Do any of you have a laptop?"
No response, but that's not unusual. Laptops are banned in classes anyway.
ERIC: "Cell phones?"
Technically, we're not allowed to bring them into the building, but most younger students tend to ignore that rule. But still, I'm met with silence, until Sid hands me a phone.
SID: "Here you go."
ERIC: "You carry this around?"
SID: "Maybe I'm not quite who you thought I am."
There's no reception of course, not in this weather, but I'm not interested in that. We have light now.

Sid and I walk through the open doors to the auditorium. By the light of the phone, we navigate the stairs and almost as soon as we stand before the stage, I notice someone sitting on the ledge, four feet from my face.

MARISA: "What are you doing here?"
ERIC: "I could ask the same."
MARISA: "There's less to distact me in here. You can go back to the entrance hall, so please don't waste your time worrying about me."
