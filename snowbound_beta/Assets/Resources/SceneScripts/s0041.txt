[perspective REBECCA] Saturday, December 12th: 6:30 AM

[enter PETE C]
PETE: "Hey everyone! Cait got through the fire door!"

I wake up in confusion. What time is it? There's not even a hint of light through the windows, but.. Wait, the snow. That's right. I check my watch. I can't even see enough to read it. 

[enter MAX B]
MAX: "It's way too early. Rebecca, my dear, tell that kid to shut up please..."
[exit MAX]
Maximilian rolls over.
STEPHEN: "What? What is this? Where's Caitlyn?"
I guess I should get up now.
[enter PETE B]
PETE: "We did it! We're through into the main hallway! Success!"
[exit PETE]
Stephen and one or two other students head out of the gymnasium as I stretch and yawn with the rest of the student body.
[enter REBECCA B]
[enter MAX D]
REBECCA: "Aren't you coming, Max?"
MAX: "Let me freeze to death here. You go have fun now, okay?"
REBECCA: "You're lazy. Sophie?"
[enter SOPHIE A]
SOPHIE: "Give me a few minutes. I'm just slow to wake up."

We follow two or three other interested students into the hall. Someone has a phone out and I can make out Caitlyn standing in the doorway. She's not looking very innocent.

[enter CAIT C]
CAIT: "I intended to tell you, I swear."
[enter STEPHEN E]
STEPHEN: "When would that be?"
CAIT: "What I was sure it would work. I was going to clean up the mess and then let Kenneth know, except this little punk decided it would be a good idea to let everyone know."
[enter PETE B]
PETE: "Oh come on, you said this would be secret, right? Just you and me! You mean you lied?"
CAIT: "Only because you broke your promise."
[enter MAX D]
MAX: "Well to be fair, you went back on your word first."
When did he show up?
STEPHEN: "It doesn't matter. I'll wait for Kenneth to deal with you. How did you get the door open?"
PETE: "Easy. Cait hollowed out the area behind the card reader, so I reached in, fiddled around, and undid the bar that holds the door in place."
CAIT: "I can't believe I busted my knife just for this. Listen, Pete, you'll pay for this."
PETE: "Pay for what? I'm going to get something to eat."
[exit PETE]
STEPHEN: "Hey, what do you think you're doing?"
But Pete scoots out and Stephen returns to Cait.
STEPHEN: "Thanks for opening the door, but we'll handle things from here. But to think I thought you were with us..."
[exit STEPHEN]
CAIT: "I am. Haven't I been telling you that?"
[exit MAX]
[enter MAX B]
[enter KENNETH E]
[enter STEPHEN D]
KENNETH: "Alright, what's going on again?"
STEPHEN: "That Caitlyn girl opened up one of the fire doors."
KENNETH: "Excellent."
STEPHEN: "But you didn't order it. And she was trying to hide it."
KENNETH: "Oh, well... Does it matter now though?"
STEPHEN: "Fine. You're the boss."
KENNETH: "Let's deal with food before we head out there. It looks really dark."
MAX: "That's because there aren't any lights on, dear leader."
[exit KENNETH]
[exit STEPHEN]
[enter REBECCA D]
[enter SOPHIE E]
I nudge Maximilian to get him to shut up, but Kenneth and Stephen walk back to gymnasium. Cait moves over to join us.
CAIT: "One of these days, that Pete kid will finally learn that his actions have consequences. I don't think he understands that."
REBECCA: "He might understand it; he just doesn't care."
CAIT: "Doesn't matter. I'll make him care."
SOPHIE: "But really... What are you trying to do back there?"
CAIT: "I just wanted to open up the main hallway so we could get to the main office. I wanted to do it myself though, not with those two stuffy track guys. They're useful, but I don't know how long I can go along with them. I just want to get back to my dorm."
SOPHIE: "I don't know... I have a bad feeling. Wouldn't they be here by now?"
REBECCA: "Don't say things like that. Let's just do what we have to for now. And right now, I don't feel like missing breakfast."

We head back to the gymnasium. It's noticeably colder this morning than last night. Actually, without the light, it feels more like the night just keeps dragging on. Nevertheless, Stephen is standing by the expedition supply boxes, distributing one can of food to each student. I eat with Maximilian and Sophie. We sit and watch Cait argue with Stephen as Kenneth observes. If this situation continues, I get the feeling that this will be a common scene.

It feels like I should take a shower, but that would be too bizarre. Students are starting to move back and forth to the locker rooms and the pool now, and the group is becoming more split up.

[enter MAX B]
[enter REBECCA D]
MAX: "I've tired of doing nothing."
REBECCA: "Odd, I thought you never would."
MAX: "See, you'd never say that to Sophie."
REBECCA: "Sophie is much more than polite than you."
MAX: "My gentlemanly honor is insulted. But more to the point, I'm sick of doing nothing."
REBECCA: "So I heard."
MAX: "Let's investigate the main hall and see if we can't get in touch with Eric, Laura, and Sid."
