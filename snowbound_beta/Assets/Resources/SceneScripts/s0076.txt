I decide to wait here. Biology isn't too far from here, and the professor let us out of calculus early.

STEPHEN: "Oh, it's you again."
REBECCA: "Again? What's that supposed to mean?"
STEPHEN: "Nothing."
REBECCA: "That's my line. I'm not playing around with you."
STEPHEN: "And you think I am?"
REBECCA: "Who knows? I don't know you."
STEPHEN: "Then why are you talking to me?"
REBECCA: "You're talking to me, you know. And I like knowing everyone."
STEPHEN: "That's not an effective use of your time."

He leaves. I should probably follow him.

I'm in biology now. Half of the reason I chose this class is because I knew Sophie, a junior I met last year, would also be taking it. Most classes I have at least a few people I know and talk to on a regular basis, but there are fewer I talk to outside of the classroom.

SOPHIE: "Hi, Rebecca. You're almost late."
REBECCA: "Hm, oh well."
SOPHIE: "It's good to see you anyway."
REBECCA: "You too, Sophie."
She's Sophie Morrigan, a friend I know from last year. She's a quiet person, and we tend to understand each other fairly well."
SOPHIE: "Have you heard about Ophelia?"
REBECCA: "Who?
SOPHIE: "The hurricane, you know. It really is a hurricane now. Type 2."
REBECCA: "Oh, right. So it is."
SOPHIE: "Theories? I'm sure you have a theory. Will we have classes tomorrow?"
REBECCA: "Well, according to Maximilian it wouldn't hit until the afternoon anyway."
SOPHIE: "Oh."

I forgot. She doesn't care for Max all that much. All three of us were in the same biology course last year, the prerequisite for this class. Maximilian always assumes those that keep their thoughts to themselves must be self-centered, and as Sophie never speaks right away, that rubbed him the wrong way. But if Max knew half of the things that raced through my head, he'd probably think a lot less of me. I can't be his foil seven days a week.
