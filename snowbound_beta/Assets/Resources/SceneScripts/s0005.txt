REBECCA: "I might as well let him know."

I walk over to where Kenneth and Stephen are talking.

[enter KENNETH D]
REBECCA: "We're headed to the locker rooms. The swim team has all their stuff in there."
KENNETH: "Good idea. I'll leave it up to you then. Can you find your way?"
REBECCA: "Probably, but do you have any spare phones or flashlights? It would help."
KENNETH: "I think Stephen and Caitlyn collected some, but it's easy for people to hide phones so we don't have many. I'll lend you one though."
[enter STEPHEN E]
STEPHEN: "Wait. Why are you giving them a phone?"
KENNETH: "So they can go to the locker rooms."
STEPHEN: "Wait until the sun comes up. Then you won't need to waste phone battery."
REBECCA: "Look, all the swim team members are cold because they only have swim suits. It's winter, so the sun isn't going to come up for another few months, so it'll probably still be too dark to see tomorrow."
SOPHIE: "And we shouldn't still be stuck here tomorrow, should we?"
STEPHEN: "Kenneth, I don't recommend this."
STUDENT: "Stephen! You have a second?"
STEPHEN: "Coming!"
[exit STEPHEN]
REBECCA: "It's only one phone. Please?"
KENNETH: "Here. Come back quickly."
