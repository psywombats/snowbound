MARISA: "What?"
ERIC: "You heard me. I couldn't care less about you any more. Stop sulking in here and do something productive. I'm not here to listen to you whine."
MARISA: "I guess I should've expected that from you. The Eric Larsen I know would never show that he was hurting..."
ERIC: "Because I wasn't hurting. This is all in your head, you see?"
MARISA: "Are you joking? It's all in my head?"
ERIC: "I'm going. When you decide to liven up, feel free to come out and join us. I won't be checking in again."
MARISA: "Ha... There's no need to check back, don't worry. I won't be coming out."
ERIC: "Suit yourself."

I turn on the phone as I stand up to leave. For a second a catch of glimpse of her face before she melts into her curtain again. I head back up the steps without a backward glance. Even if I were to turn back, there would be no way to tell if she were watching me.
