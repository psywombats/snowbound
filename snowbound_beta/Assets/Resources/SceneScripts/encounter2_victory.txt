STARYU: I'll fill you full of holes, you over-filled gas bladder!
FATHEAD: Brrrr! I cast... Firebeam!
CUCU: Staryu! Watch out!
As Fathead cackles, a jet of superheated water shoots from his nose, aimed straight for your chest! Er, middle, whatever.

CUCU: Ow!
FATHEAD: Brrraaaargh! Time to flee!
[exit FATHEAD]
CUCU: He's gone.

STARYU: Oh well. I should've asked him to teleport you back home or something.
CUCU: Look! He dropped some loot!
STARYU: I'm not carrying any of that junk.
CUCU: I'll help you out, friend! Just tell me what to carry.
