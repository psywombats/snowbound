MAX: "Rebecca... That is you, right?"
I can hardly see him, even as my eyesight adjusts.
REBECCA: "Yeah, I'm here. Where's everyone else?"
PETE: "I can see you but you can't see me...!"
CAIT: "Shut up. This isn't a time to joke around. Is this everyone?"
MAX: "Where's Lara?"
REBECCA: "She left after Eric. I guess they're both in the auditorium."
MAX: "Do any of you have a cell phone on you?"
CAIT: "Even if I did, it's not like I'd get any reception. There's a storm outside, remember?"
MAX: "I'd be using it for light."
REBECCA: "Oh, Max, I've still got yours. Here."
[enter MAX A]
[enter REBECCA B]
[enter PETE C]
[enter CAIT D]
MAX: "That's better."
PETE: "Now how about the other people in here?"
There are quiet murmurs from the other side of the gym, but I don't hear any teacher shouting at us, and the intercom is silent.
MAX: "Well, we're the group with the light. Those other guys should be coming over here before too - "
[exit MAX]
[exit REBECCA]
[exit PETE]
[exit CAIT]
KENNETH: "Hey! You all! Over here!"
Someone else cuts across Max's voice.
[enter KENNETH C]
KENNETH: "Everyone in the gym, this way!
[hold]

I finally see the speaker. His face is illuminated by the glow of a laptop screen. Although I can't say I've ever talked to him, I recognize him as Kenneth Whitecastle, captain of the track team. He's only a junior, so the fact that he won captainship in the first place is telling.

KENNETH: "Is that everyone?"
[enter REBECCA A]
REBECCA: "Fencing's all here."
[enter SHIBIN E]
SHIBIN: "I count fifteen of us altogether."
KENNETH: "Right. Okay, listen up everyone. We're going to stay here either until the emergency generators turn on, or until a teacher shows up. Stay calm and we should be able to head back to the dorms before too long."
SHIBIN: "Scouts. Don't forget."
The kid holding the laptop keeps whispering to Kenneth, but I can't place him. He was in my math class last year, but I don't remember his name.
KENNETH: "Oh, yeah. You two, go down to the administration offices and bring a teacher or someone down here. Maybe they'll know what to do."
SHIBIN: "You're handling this fine, Ken. Don't worry."
KENNETH: "And bring any stragglers in here. We should stick together."
[exit KENNETH]

[exit SHIBIN]
[enter MAX A]
[enter PETE B]
[enter CAIT D]
[enter REBECCA E]
MAX: "That guy certainly gets things done fast."
PETE: "Who said he's in charge? I'm going outside."
REBECCA: "Can't you stand in one place for more than five seconds?"
[exit PETE]
CAIT: "Where are you going? It's snowing outside, you idiot! Don't you open a door!"

The students are fading in and out of sight. Cait has her arms crossed next to me and Maximilian is watching the exit to the hallway. As for the others, most are sticking around the track team captain, Kenneth. He's continually talking to that kid in my math class.

Actually, I remember him now. That's Shibin Dai. He was only a freshman last year, but he answered every single question in that math class. It didn't endear him to the rest of us, but he was never wrong.

[enter MAX A]
MAX: "They're back."
[exit MAX]
Two track teams members run up to Kenneth.
[enter KENNETH C]
KENNETH: "Change of plans. The door out of the gym hallway is locked. We can't get out to the main hall."
[exit KENNETH]
[enter MAX B]
[enter REBECCA A]
[enter CAIT D]
CAIT: "Are you kidding me? Who the hell would lock a door in the middle of a power outage?"
MAX: "It's not locked, it's just hooked up to the security system. Past school hours, you have to swipe your ID to get in, remember?"
CAIT: "Then someone swipe their ID and open the door already."
MAX: "Ahaha, easier said than done when the power's out."
CAIT: "Did anyone ever tell you your laugh is obnoxious?"
REBECCA: "Don't worry too much. Anyone in the main hallway can open the door. They still outwards."
MAX: "Thank the lord for fire codes."
CAIT: "But we're still trapped here until someone comes out that door! What're we supposed to do, just wait for the power to come back on? What if this was an emergency?"
REBECCA: "There's an exit door on the other side of the gym."
CAIT: "Aha! I'll go see what's going on outside!"
[exit CAIT]
[movewait]
[enter PETE D]
PETE: "Man, I thought she'd never leave."
REBECCA: "What were you up to?"
PETE: "I was trying to open that exit door on the other side of the gym."
REBECCA: "What?"
PETE: "It won't open."
MAX: "Y'know those doors don't lock from the inside, right?"
PETE: "I'm not that dumb, but it wouldn't open."
REBECCA: "No way... Is there really that much snow out?"
MAX: "There's no way to tell, is there?"

I stay with Max and Pete in the center of the gym. It doesn't take too long before Cait comes rushing back, but instead of coming to us, I see her talking to Kenneth. Before too long, Shibin has the laptop hoisted above his head again, and Kenneth stands up.

[enter KENNETH C]
[enter SHIBIN B]
[enter CAIT D]
KENNETH: "It looks like the gym door is malfunctioning. It's locked or something."
MAX: "Exit doors don't lock, numbnuts!"
No one responds. 
KENNETH: "We'll figure it out later. What's next?"
SHIBIN: "The swim team."
KENNETH: "Right. You guys, what's the status on the students at the pool and in the hallways?"
STUDENT: "The swim team is in there, but the door won't open. We swiped our IDs but no luck."
CAIT: "Isn't there some other way in?"
SHIBIN: "They're fine, they have an exit door as well."
KENNETH: "But we can open the door from the here out to the gym hallway?"
STUDENT: "There's a doorstop there. We'll have to be careful not to close the door or we wouldn't be able to get out."
KENNETH: "Okay, you, stand by the door and make sure it never shuts. And if anyone can think of something steadier than a doorstop to keep a door open, let me know."
STUDENT: "Got it."

We're left to our own devices once more. Cait's still talking to Shibin and Kenneth, and I can't find Pete anywhere. However, I have other concerns.

[enter REBECCA B]
[enter MAX D]
REBECCA: "Hey Maximilian... How is anyone on the staff going to get in?"
MAX: "That's not what I'm concerned about."
REBECCA: "What? You're not worried?"
MAX: "No, I'm more afraid that the teachers won't be able to even get to the entrances. Think for a minute. Who else is in this building?"
REBECCA: "Hm... The debate team, jazz ensemble, whatever teachers decided to stay late, and probably the school director."
MAX: "Who'd stay late on a day when there's a ton of snow expected?"
Throughout our conversation, Max doesn't lose his small smile.
REBECCA: "Huh. We might be here a while."
MAX: "Just think of it like a big hiking trip wherein we camp under the stars, my dear."
REBECCA: "Is this just one big joke to you? Do you realize how bad this could be?"
MAX: "On the contrary, do you? I'm the one who pointed out that we're trapped in here. Of course I know. I know enough not to get worked up about it. I'd rather plan ahead than panic."

That's one way to put it. Maximilian Wolf is not one to lose his calm over anything minor like being trapped for hours by a blizzard in a school with an apparntly faulty generator system at the mercy of a senile school director and electronic locks. No, nothing to worry about.

Over at the far wall, everyone else is starting to sit down. Most are talking, and a few students have out books and laptops. Maybe they've understood the situation as well. Shibin and Cait are both talking to Kenneth at once. Pete, however, emerges from the group to join Max and me.

[enter PETE B]
[enter MAX D]
[enter REBECCA E]
PETE: "Jesus, does everyone in this school have an opinion? They're having a full-blown strategy meeting over there."
He gestures at Shibin and Cait, now mostly arguing with each other as Kenneth looks on.
PETE: "Who is that guy anyway?"
MAX: "Kenneth Whitecastle. Some pretty boy track captain."
PETE: "Well, he certainly looks like he knows what he's doing."
MAX: "It looks that way, at least."
PETE: "Hm... Maybe I'll have some fun with the exit door over there. I wonder what kind of lock it has."
MAX: "That's irrelevant. It's not meant to prevent people from leaving. There's something outside that's preventing it from opening. Whether that's high wind, snow, or both, I don't know."
PETE: "Oh that's a shame. Give me something to do."
REBECCA: "Go talk to Kenneth, then. He's passing out jobs left and right."
PETE: "That's boring. How long are we supposed to be down here anyway?"
REBECCA: "I don't know. It might me longer than we expected."
PETE: "Fine. I'll go explore."
[exit PETE]
And he heads out the broken fire door and into the gym hallway.
[exit REBECCA]
[enter REBECCA B]
MAX: "How did he even get admitted?"
REBECCA: "Search me."
MAX: "I'm surprised though, Rebecca."
REBECCA: "What?"
MAX: "Aren't you concerned about Sophie? She's stuck at the pool with the rest of the swim team."
REBECCA: "That's right... Well should we check up on her?"
MAX: "Don't ask me."
