ERIC: "Marisa should be fine, I guess... If she needed anything, she'd come out."
SID: "Were you saying something?"
ERIC: "Just thinking about Marisa. Sorry, I'll stop muttering."
SID: "That's fine."

We sit on our table facing the windows to the fading gray outside, but every few minutes I can't help but glance over my shoulder. It's not that I feel Marisa's eyes on me, but if she makes an appearance, it wouldn't be good to miss it.

SID: "What are you thinking about, Eric?"
ERIC: "What? Oh, nothing. I was just uh, wondering how the students in the gym are doing."
Actually, come to think of it, I wonder why I wasn't more concerned about Rebecca, Max, Laura and the rest before.
SID: "They should be fine."
ERIC: "You think?"
SID: "They have the supplies from the expedition closet, right? They'd outlast us for sure. It's not like a little hardship will drive everyone insane, so I'm sure they're cooperating, just like we are."
ERIC: "Are we really cooperating, though?"
SID: "Well, we're certainly not in some sort of every-man-for-himself nightmare scenario, that's for sure."
ERIC: "True enough. But look at them."
No one's fighting over the water or food, but no one's dividing anything up, either. Most of the students, like us, are splintered up into groups of two are three.
SID: "I'm sure they're all talking to themselves about what a fragmented and dysfunctional lot everyone else is too. It's best not to think too much about it."
ERIC: "You're right, of course. All we can do is wait until there's an opportunity to do something about this mess."

What little sunlight was visible through the filter of the whirling snow dies off as the evening progresses. Henry shrinks to just a shadow walking back and forth against the glass. I stare up at the ceiling, now just as black as the rest of the hall.
