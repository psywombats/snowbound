CUCU: Good idea, bud!
STARYU: Well don't just sit there. Hand over the map!
Cucu offers you a scrap of paper with his stringy cucumber arm.
STARYU: What on earth is this? This map is tiny. Like, 3 by 3 inches tops.
CUCU: That's just how it is, friend!
STARYU: I can't read anything on this. Just take it back.
CUCU: I'll read the map for you and tell you where to go! Doesn't that sound fun!
STARYU: I find it hard to believe you can see anything period, but I'm gonna get my revenge on Squidius no matter what. So stop standing around and tell me where I should be going.

The map serves you well. You arrive on a winding path that spirals deeper into the ocean. This map even seems to have some treasure marked on it. Maybe Cucu isn't so worthless after all.

STARYU: Okay, this should be the X on the map. Get digging, Cucu.
CUCU: Okie dokie boss!
Watching Cucu dig is a painful sight. But finally...
CUCU: Treasure!
STARYU: Hurry up and open it! We'll need anything we can find to defeat Squidius.
CUCU: Hurrrf... Urrrrfff...
STARYU: Can you be a little more quiet about it?
CUCU: Ha! Finally, the treasure is ours! Huzzah! But uh... There's a lot in here!
STARYU: Woah...

Soaked in Cucu's cucumber slime, the chest lies open before you. Firearms, nunchuks, mystic artifacts, laser rifles, wands brimming with arcane power... Inside lies a weapon cache sufficient to arm a small nation. Or to arm a questionably-armed starfish. There's only one problem, however...

CUCU: How are we gonna carry all this stuff, bro?
STARYU: Put that thing down before you turn yourself into a sea pickle and let me sort this out.

You have nine arms, but only enough inventory space for one of these items. Which will it be?

[choice]
[SIG Sauer P226 :: gun]
[Runed trident "Ire of Poseidon" :: trident]
[Tactical nuke :: nuke]
