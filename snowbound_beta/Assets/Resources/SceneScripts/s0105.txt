REBECCA: "Are you joking? Count me out."
MAX: "Stephen, one of these days you'll realize that the only people who like it when you boss them around are sycophants and idiots."
STEPHEN: "I don't need any of that from you, Maximilian Wolf. You're useful, and you're an ally when our interests align. That's good enough from me, so keep doing what you're doing."
Anyone but Stephen would've taken offense to a comment like that, but he doesn't even try to deny it.
MAX: "Haha, you're just fine, Stephen. See you around."

MAX: "Intelligence officer? Oh please. What is this, the Gestapo?"
REBECCA: "I guess he's an old-fashioned hierarchy guy after all. He's trying to set up everyone else under him and Kenneth on top."
MAX: "Don't get the wrong idea, Rebecca."
His attitude changes in an instant.
MAX: "If Stephen was only after peace and quiet, I'd be fine with it. But I think he's after control."
REBECCA: "You think so?"
MAX: "You're giving me a weird look. I thought you, of all people, would've already noticed how he's latched on to Kenneth. It's not normal."
REBECCA: "I'll take your word for it."

No kidding, of course I've noticed that. I guess I shouldn't be so surprised that Max is suspicious about Stephen as well, but he usually keeps observations like that to himself. Maybe he really is worried that I might join up with them.
