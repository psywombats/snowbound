What ensues is Henry at his best. Over the next two hours, he directs the work from the top and bottom to rig an elevator system stable enough to transport supplies and people from the stage to the catwalks. The jazz ensemble members are all responsive and we do our best to construct the lift out of the cords littering the backstage area. The base of the elevator is comprised of half of the stage curtain with the rope anchored at the four corners. Sid loops the rope over the pulley at the rafters and tosses it down. I anchor it to a few of the weights while Henry stands on the curtain to keep it down.

As a test run, we send up the remaining water bottles. I adjust the weights to equal the weight of the water, and Sid, Felix, and Marilyn control the speed from the top of the system. After they reach the top, I undo the weights to drop the curtain back to stage level. Henry opts to be the first up the system, and the operation is successful. One by one, each other student is hoisted into the air and steps off onto the catwalk. I attach the counterweights one last time and ascend.

SID: "Good work, Henry."
MARILYN: "I agree. That was brilliant."
HENRY: "Thanks, but, uh, should we do something about her...?"
FELIX: "The dead one?"
Marisa is lying on floor in an unnatural position. Felix shines the light back and forth a few times.
ERIC: "There's nothing we can do."
FELIX: "Eric, you have to explain this to me. I thought you had retired. I thought you weren't interested in the standings any more. What did you do that convinced her to kill herself? Maybe I should thank you..."
ERIC: "What? No, I didn't have anything to do with this."
I say that, but I have my own doubts.
MARILYN: "Felix, don't."
FELIX: "It wouldn't be right if I didn't thank him. I have my honor, you know."
MARILYN: "She's dead, the poor thing, so be quiet about it."
Felix moves away and we make to leave through the catwalk door.
ERIC: "Who are you? I don't believe we've met."
MARILYN: "Marilyn Sumner. I'm the vice-captain of the debate team. A junior."
ERIC: "Eric Larsen, archery team captain, senior."
We shake hands.
