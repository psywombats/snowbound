ERIC: "Marisa?"
MARISA: "I thought it was you, Eric. I thought you would've noticed I was just standing here by now."
ERIC: "I'm sorry to disappoint."
MARISA: "Don't worry. It's hard to disappoint me at this point."
ERIC: "Are you finally coming out of there?"
MARISA: "No. I'm not crossing over the line, Eric."
She gestures at the rut in the floor separating the entrance hall from the stairs into the seating area.
ERIC: "What's got you cooped up in there?"
MARISA: "Ethics, Eric."
ERIC: "You still have ethics?"
I can see her breath as she sighs.
MARISA: "We haven't spoken for two months, Eric. Did you know that?"
ERIC: "I knew that."
MARISA: "We might not ever speak again."
ERIC: "As much as I wish that were true, I wouldn't put money on it."
MARISA: "Ha. Actually, this is just how I deserve it, isn't it Eric? I'll go back now. You have fun out here."
She vanishes back into the dark. Before I can follow, Sid is at my shoulder.
SID: "What was that about?"
ERIC: "I guess that probably seemed a little weird, didn't it..."
SID: "Uh, just a little. What's with you? I've never seen you get nasty like that at someone."
