SQUIDIUS: Well well well... What do we have here? A starfish and his loyal companion?
STARYU: Too loyal.
CUCU: Squidius! Thank you for the arms!
SQUIDIUS: Heh heh heh... All part of my plan.
STARYU: You! You're the reason the other starfish look down on me! With this many arms, I'm a mutant!
SQUIDIUS: How naive... Nine is the perfect number! Don't you see?
STARYU: All I see is that we'll never see eye to eye, Squidius. You gave me these arms, and now I'll use them to defeat you!
