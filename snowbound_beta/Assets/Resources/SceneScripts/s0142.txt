ERIC: "How about we check the conference room first?"
SID: "Alright. I have one of those counterweights from the auditorium with me, so we should be able to break through the glass windows."
ERIC: "Do you know how to get back down to the stage?"
SID: "Without Henry working the lift, that's going to be a little harder."
ERIC: "Can you climb down the wall again?"
SID: "I could, but I'm not sure if you could. And if you're not there to spot me, I'd be in serious trouble if I lost my grip. You know, actually, I'm not comfortable with that."
ERIC: "Maybe we can think up some other way..."
SID: "Henry would be the best one for that job. Maybe we should've talked to him before setting out like this."
ERIC: "Well, maybe we'll just put off returning to the entrance hall for now."
LAURA: "Have you made up your mind on where to go yet?"
SID: "Uh, well, it's your call Eric, I guess, but I'd prefer not going down the auditorium wall just yet."
