It's 4:30. I would've thought Sid would be here by now, at least. There's maybe a fifty percent chance Max and Rebecca will show, Marisa's never coming back, and I have no idea how many freshman would be interested in the world's worst fencing team. Even with my last minute decision, we'll probably be disbanded this year after all.

The empty seats of the student club room stare back at me. I have no idea why anyone would want to meet in here. It's set up like some sort of corporate conference room, as if I should be running a business here, not a half-hearted sports club.

[enter ERIC A]
SID: "Hello."
ERIC: "Hey, Sid."
[exit SID]
[enter SID D]
He takes a seat.
SID: "I forgot to tell you, I'm going to have to miss this first meeting."
ERIC: "Oh, it looks to me like you're already here. Where are you headed?"
SID: "I have a rehearsal today."
ERIC: "I thought most of the other practices were cancelled because of the weather."
SID: "Mine isn't. It starts in five minutes."
ERIC: "Hm. You never told me you were in an ensemble. Which one?"
SID: "Jazz band. And I never told you because I figured you'd think it was pointless."
ERIC: "What?"
SID: "Bye."

Maybe this meeting will be a one-person affair anyway... Bad luck. I was sort of looking forward to it.

[enter REBECCA C]
MAX: "Wow, look at all these new members."
REBECCA: "Don't rub it in, Max. Hey Eric."
ERIC: "Hi. I was beginning to worry no one would show up."
MAX: "This is pretty much no one. You should be ashamed."
When I don't respond, we're left sitting in silence.
ERIC: "If it makes it any better, Sid's joining but he just had somewhere else to go."
MAX: "Hm, I forget, how many members did we need to entice to remain a team? How silly of me to forget."
We need two more, but I 'd rather not talk to Max. We weren't exactly best of friends last year, and his smile is just for show.
MAX: "Oh, put a little spine into it. I know you probably wanted this club dissolved anyway, but this is just lame."
I'm conditioned to catch myself from talking back without thinking, but before I can reply, Max stands up, yawns, and pokes his head out into the hallway.
[exit MAX]
[enter MAX E]
MAX: "Hey! Whoever's interested in joining the world-famous St Magnus team for martial arts, swordplay, muscle-building, stamina-enhancing, free-credit-guaranteed team better get in here!"
REBECCA: "Christ Max, what the - "

If I kill Max now, that's one less member recruited. Now there's about a zero percent chance that anyone normal will join this team. Then again, maybe that was always the case. Well, in this school shouldn't I be looking for people out of place anyway? I need to check myself before I revert into my old way of thinking.

MAX: "Hey, it worked! What's your name?"
CAIT: "I'm Caitlyn Baquiran."
MAX: "I'm Maximilian Wolf, master of the sword. It's a real pleasure to welcome you to - "
CAIT: "I'm not shaking your hand or I'll catch whatever crazy disease you've got. Now is this some kind of knife-fighting league? Karate team? Who's the real captain around here?"
ERIC: "Hi. I'm Eric, nice to meet you. We're the fencing team."
CAIT: "Oh... Well, I guess that's almost like knife-fighting. I guess I'll join."
She pulls out a seat at the table but stops before sitting.
CAIT: "There are three of you. That's not a team."
ERIC: "Sid couldn't make it to the first meeting, and uh, we still need to recruit one more if we want to be an official team..."
MAX: "I can holler again."
CAIT: "Sit down, will you? There are better recruitment strategies."
[exit CAIT]
REBECCA: "Where's she going?"
MAX: "No idea. Do you know her? Cause she seems like quite the tightwad."
REBECCA: "She's not really uptight, just independent. Plus she doesn't appreciate when -"
MAX: "Why do you have everyone's psychological profile?"
REBECCA: "We had a semester of English together."
MAX: "Watch out, Eric. Rebecca's had twice as long to know you, so she probably has a statsheet on your weakness by now. When she hands it out to the other seniors, your run at valedictorian over."

Those words might be more correct than he thinks. I wonder if Max is just joking around or Rebecca really did figure out what happened. There should be only one person who knows that. My thoughts are interrupted by a shuffling at the door.

[enter LARA A]
CAIT: "Here. I've recruited our sixth member. Tell them your name."
LARA: "Lara Cygnus. Can I ask what team this is?"
MAX: "Muscle-building, cow-tipping, virility-boosting -"
CAIT: "Shut up. This is the fencing team, and it's not polite to mislead people."
[exit LARA]
[enter PETE A]
PETE: "You're the one misleading people, haha."
CAIT: "And who are you?"
PETE: "I'm Pete Sai. I'm joining the free-credit-guaranteed fencing team."
ERIC: "Good, that's one more than we need to register as a team. Should we start the meeting?"
CAIT: "Not before this kid apologizes."
PETE: "You should apologize to Lara then. You forced her to join for nothing."
[exit PETE]
[enter LARA A]
LARA: "I'm fine. Fencing sounds interesting actually."
MAX: "Don't feel like you have to stay."
REBECCA: "Max, don't kick her out."
ERIC: "Look, can we just start this meeting already? We've got two tournaments this year instead of only one last year, and - "
I stop when Max starts glaring at me.
[exit LARA]
[enter PETE A]
PETE: "Hey, we should go down to the gym and check out the snow."
[hold]

Here we are: my first choice as incompetent captain of the fencing club. Maybe I should stop thinking about how to run this team and step back a moment. I don't know how to control these people or even if I should be controlling them.
