Wednesday, November 16th: Day 6

[enter HENRY A]
HENRY: "Hey!"
I wake up to a clatter and a shout.
[enter ERIC D]
ERIC: "Henry! What the hell?"
HENRY: "Whoa, who are all these people?"
[enter CAIT C]
CAIT: "Hey, stand back!"
HENRY: "Get that thing out of my face!"

In under a second, Cait pounces at the figure in the doorway. How does she pull out her knife that quickly? Henry stumbles back out of the lounge while I run after them both. I catch sight of Sid and Lara rubbing their eyes on the way out. Hopefully Cait hasn't stabbed Henry yet.

[enter CAIT B]
[enter HENRY D]
HENRY: "Eric, who the hell is this?"
CAIT: "I told you Felix would send spies!"
