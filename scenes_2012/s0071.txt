Friday, November 24th: Day 14

Most of this morning passes without incident. We all know what needs to happen. We're all up by the first light. There isn't much conversation. Everyone rolls their sleeping bags and grabs a backpack. Of course, the number of prepared items is exact. Felix and Sophie each take one end of Marilyn's stretcher. When everyone is prepared, Kenneth opens the fire door to the gym hallway.

The group follows the same circuitous route Eric and I followed yesterday. Down the south stairs, across the student lounge, up the north stairs, through the staff office... Max and Kenneth lead the way while Cait and Shibin bring up the rear. For my part, I stand towards the back of the group of us crowding around the cleared passage in the snow. Eric is right beside me. Our hands are together.

One by one, the students climb the carved stairwell in the packed snow into the light snow above. The wind and air and sun are beautiful. We set out towards civilization, if it still exists out there. Around me, the faces blur and run as we walk and walk and walk. However, there is one person by my side who never changes, and together we go forth into whatever remains of the world outside.
