ERIC: "Well, it'd have to be quite the storm to hold up the highway, especially if they have the plows out..."
SID: "I knew it."
HENRY: "You know, I think I'll follow my own advice. I'll be in the auditorium if you need me. Maybe then I'll resist the urge to clobber you. You really shouldn't pick fights when everyone's so high-strung, you know?"
I lose sight of him as he crosses the threshold to the auditorium.
ERIC: "He can have fun with Marisa, I guess..."
SID:  "What's his problem?"
ERIC: "I don't know. You probably spend more time with him than me. What were you bugging him for, anyway? Was he a pain during the rehearsal today or something?"
SID: "No, nothing like that. He practices hard and he plays well. He's a little boring, but that's the only complaint I can make."
ERIC: "Then why...?"
SID: "Maybe I'm a little tense after all. I wouldn't say the situation makes me nervous, but... It's unsettling."
ERIC: "I know what you mean. There's something not right about this whole thing."

Sid and I claim one of the tables in the entryway and resume our post. A few of the students are still glued to the glass, but most have resigned themselves to confinement at this point. No one goes towards the auditorium door. I keep my eye out for Marisa, but after an hour, the only one to come out is Henry. He nods at us and joins the students at the windows. Sid and I carry on a conversation, but my heart isn't in it. Something in the snow has my attention... or maybe it's something back in the auditorium.

SID: "Hm..."
ERIC: "What's up?"
