ERIC: "I'm heading back to the entrance hall. You enjoy yourself."

MARISA: "You really hate me, don't you? I don't blame you Eric, remember that. And don't blame yourself."

I knew listening to her was a bad idea. I was just starting to adjust to the situation, and now she delivers that unnerving speech. Is she at home in here, or is she more unsettled than the rest of us? I don't think she's mentally disturbed, but that was certainly not normal. When I reach the top of the stairs, someone stops me.

SID: "Hello."
[enter SID D]
ERIC: "I guess no one's really asleep yet."
SID: "No, I was pretty much there until Marisa brushed by on her way out."
ERIC: "Then you heard that?"
SID: "I heard what little there was to hear. It's not worth calling eavesdropping. I doubt I'll be able to sleep in this hall anyway. Instead, let's talk."
ERIC: "Fine."
We return to the usual table.
