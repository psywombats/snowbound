I exit the room.

SOPHIE: "Rebecca. It's good to see you."
I'm in biology now. Half of the reason I chose this class is because I knew Sophie, a junior I met last year, would also be taking it. Most classes I have at least a few people I know and talk to on a regular basis, but there are fewer I talk to outside of the classroom.
REBECCA: "Hi, Sophie. Good to see you too."
SOPHIE: "Hm, looks like class won't be starting for another few minutes."

Sophie returns to waiting for the professor to arrive. She's always been quiet, but I know she's always thinking. Maybe in that way she's similar to me. But I know what she's thinking about. It's always the problem at hand. I can tell without a doubt that she's reviewing today's homework, not necessarily because it's important to her but that's what she has to do. I understand her. But she looks back up.

SOPHIE: "You've heard about Ophelia?"
REBECCA: "Who?"
SOPHIE: "The hurricane, you know. It really is a hurricane now. Type 2."
REBECCA: "Oh, right. So it is."
SOPHIE: "Theories? I'm sure you have a theory. Will we have classes tomorrow?"
REBECCA: "Well, according to Maximilian it wouldn't hit until the afternoon anyway."
SOPHIE: "Oh."

I forgot. She doesn't care for Max all that much. All three of us were in the same biology course last year, the prerequisite for this class. Maximilian always assumes those that keep their thoughts to themselves must be self-centered, and as Sophie never speaks right away, that rubbed him the wrong way.

I don't agree with Max's theory. If he knew half of the things that raced through my head, he'd probably think a lot less of me. I can't be his foil seven days a week. Around people like Sophie, I tend to keep my quiet too. And so, I take out my homework as well.
