REBECCA: "I can't do it, Eric. There are too many people here that I care about."
ERIC: "Maybe I feel the same. Leaving here now would be betraying everyone else."
REBECCA: "Then what do you hope happens instead? Do some other students leave as scouts?"
ERIC: "I don't think I can justify that."
REBECCA: "You're right. What is there for us in this school anymore?"
ERIC: "We all have to leave."
REBECCA: "We'll all go together."
ERIC: "I'm sure the two of us can find some way to convince Felix, Max, and the rest of them."
We both turn around at the sound of footsteps in the hallway.

PETE: "You have to see this! I unlocked the stairwell and I ran up to the top, and the door almost opens up there! You can see the sky!"
REBECCA: "You're kidding. That's amazing."
ERIC: "Well, let's have a look."

We follow Pete back down the English hallway, through Felix's den, and up the access stairwell to the rooftop door. Until this week, I'd never been in the staff lounge. I never knew this flight of stairs existed, and I guess most of us forgot about it until now. My breath is taken away when we reach the top. I can feel wind. Only now do I realize how stale the air was all this time. The chill breeze is glorious.

PETE: "Isn't it amazing?"

ERIC: "You can even see the sky..."

Sunlight shines through a two-inch gap in the pile of snow outside the door.
PETE: "I could only open it a crack, but it's enough to prove the point. We can get out of here!"

REBECCA: "Nice work, Pete."
He starts shoveling the snow into the staircase from the narrow opening.
ERIC: "Rebecca, come on, let's go tell the rest."
