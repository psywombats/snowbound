Sid is standing over by the doors when I emerge. I'm glad he wasn't listening in this time. However, when I walk over, he turns around.

[enter ERIC B]
[enter SID D]
ERIC: "I've got your phone."
SID: "Thanks. You talked to her, then?"
ERIC: "A bit."
SID: "You don't look very happy."
ERIC: "Why would I be? I only did it for the phone."
SID: "Well, I hope you're capable of dealing with her now. It would look bad if we let her starve to death in there."
It doesn't seem a good moment to mention that she didn't accept the water.
ERIC: "What is there to do now?"
SID: "Nothing. Absolutely nothing."
ERIC: "It feels useless. I guess it's enough to bring anyone down."
SID: "Ha, even Henry down there."
When he laughs, he's clearly not amused.
ERIC: "Then I propose we wait until a better action becomes apparent."
SID: "Now you're acting more like the Eric Larsen I know. I second the motion."

And so, we sit down at our table and stare up at the dark ceiling of the entrance hall.
