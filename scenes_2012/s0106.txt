REBECCA: "Marisa, wait."
PETE: "Uh, what are you doing?"
MARISA: "Who is that?"
REBECCA: "It's Rebecca Bell."
MARISA: "What do you want?"
I'm not even sure myself.
REBECCA: "Is everyone safe down there?"
PETE: "Well if she's yammering about Eric hunting her down or something, then obviously not..."
MARISA: "Yes, they're fine. You should come back tomorrow."
REBECCA: "Okay. Be careful, alright?"
MARISA: "Worry about yourself, please."
I step away from the door.
PETE: "She sounds like a psycho. How do you even meet these crazy people?"
REBECCA: "Everyone in here's a nutjob if you look hard enough."
PETE: "Wait, you think I'm crazy too?"
REBECCA: "With you, one doesn't have to look very hard."
PETE: "Har har, very funny."
REBECCA: "Let's go report back to Shibin."
PETE: "Failed missions suck though..."

As we walk back down the gym hall, I run over everything I know about Marisa, trying to come up with anything to explain her behavior. I come up empty. I'd be fine with settling on the Marisa-is-crazy theory if I hadn't known her to be such a stoic last year. She may not have talked much, but she always struck me as a very rational, determined person. I hope she's safe in there.
