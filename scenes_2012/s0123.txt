ERIC: "I'd have to say no. We can't put Felix in charge."
SID: "Why don't you think so?"
ERIC: "To him, we're second class already. His loyalties are to the debate team members. It's like Marilyn said: what separates us is where we started out."
SID: "Wait, but what she meant was that we didn't have any real reason to stay separate."
ERIC: "But Felix doesn't see it that way. If it came down to the jazz ensemble or the debate team, who do you think he'd give the last of the food to?"
SID: "You're right. He'd definitely give it to his own students. So you think we're better off on our own?"
ERIC: "Even if we have to trade with Felix for everything, it's best to keep our independence."
SID: "I'm glad you still have your head on straight. It's too bad Marilyn's already stuck out her neck for us."
Marilyn's walking back across the catwalk from her conference with Felix, who is now shouting down to Henry on the stage floor.

MARILYN: "I'm sorry, guys. I couldn't get through to him."
SID: "Don't worry about it."
MARILYN: "I'll see if I can't talk to him some time in the future, but don't place any bets on it, okay?"
ERIC: "Thanks for your help."

She walks back to Felix. At this point, he's almost done delivering the bundle of food and other supplies down to Henry via the pulley lift.
SID: "She's another one with her head in the right place."
ERIC: "And her heart too, I guess."
We cross the stage to the other side of the auditorium where Henry is staggering around with the package in his hands.
[enter HENRY A]
HENRY: "There! I've got it now!"
SID: "You look like you're about to fall over. Just put it down!"
[exit HENRY]
[enter FELIX A]
FELIX: "Is that everything?"
ERIC: "I think that's all. Thanks for the trade, Felix. It was nice doing business with you."
FELIX: "You too, Eric. Maybe we'll be back."
[exit FELIX]
[enter MARILYN A]
MARILYN: "See you later."

All in all, the debate team was here for less than an hour. As I think back over the past couple days, that's the first contact I've had with anyone outside this group of six students in a long while. Now we might not see them for days... If only the outside world would remember us before then.

SID: "We should really do something about her."
ERIC: "What?"
He points at Marisa's sprawled corpse.
ERIC: "I didn't need to be reminded about that."
SID: "It would be bad to leave her lying on the floor like that."
ERIC: "Henry!"
[enter HENRY E]
HENRY: "What? I'm tired."
ERIC: "Don't forget our deal. Sid and I cut her down, and you take it from there."
HENRY: "Fine, fine. I'll get to it eventually. Can't I relax for even a minute?"

As we exit the auditorium with the sack of food, I suspect Henry won't be following through. The auditorium door slams shut, and I hope we never have to open it again. Now that today's excitement is wearing off, I can only think of one image: Marisa, ten feet off the floor.
