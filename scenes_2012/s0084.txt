Saturday, November 19th: Day 9

It's the middle of the night. Is it morning yet? No, the sun isn't up yet. Out the window, nothing is visible. Whether it's from the snow or it's just too early, I don't know. Rebecca wakes up beside me.

We move closer together again. It feels natural to be with her. Our own little universe in this stairwell will end tomorrow. Freedom will be nice, but I wish we could stick together. I wonder... If we ever escape, what will be between us? Will be both forget this time like a bad dream? It's not something I want to think about. Instead, I'll attempt to enjoy our remaining nighttime. Maybe tomorrow we'll have all the food and water we need to last many more nights like this. It's all I can do to hope. Back to sleep.
