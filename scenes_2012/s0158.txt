ERIC: "Do it yourself if you like, but I don't see what it accomplishes. The snow's pressed so hard against the door that we can't even open it, so what makes you think you'll be able to break through?
HENRY: "Eric, that's not the point. Are you just going to sit there and laugh at us people who are trying to get out of here? I don't care if it's not realistic, but it's better than nothing, isn't it?"
SID: "Well, if all you accomplish is damaging the school, then..."
HENRY: "Fine. I'll do it by myself if all of you intend to sit around and feel sorry for yourself instead of getting anything done."

Sid and I pass the next hour or so watching Henry try and kick through the heavy glass that makes up the front wall of the entrance hall. Judging from the protracted panting and grunting, his continued exertion is taking a toll on his stamina. The glass, however, remains impervious.

SID: "Hm, do you really think it can't be broken?"
ERIC: "I don't know if it could be or not. It's not going to be broken by Henry's foot though, that's for sure."
SID: "Maybe I should suggest he hit it with one of those ceramic chairs or something. This is kind of pathetic."
ERIC: "You can help if you want."
SID: "I think I'd rather watch, actually. Henry's been bugging me lately."
ERIC: "Oh really?"
SID: "He won't sit still. I understand that he wants to do something productive, but when there's truly nothing productive to be done, isn't it better to just conserve energy?"
ERIC: "Well, Henry isn't the most logical fellow."
SID: "He's certainly an amusing one, though."

The other students aren't particularly entertained. After a few minutes, most of them start ignoring him. As even Sid and I stop paying him any attention, Henry finally collapses by the door.

ERIC: "Is he asleep?"
SID: "I guess so."
ERIC: "So that's the end of the escape attempt... Oh well."
