Rebecca is driven by a need to understand the thought processes of others. She's a good listener, but her personality and demeanor often switch depending on who she's conversing with. She's the type to keep a constant internal monologue and carefully maintain an outer and inner self. Rebecca keeps a variety of friends, some of them good students and others more shady, all with their own perception of her and her own relationship with them, so she's well-known but possesses no circle of friends. She's most open with Maximilian, whom she's known since D-year, but still very cautious with acquaintances. If asked to describe her, all who know her would give a different answer. </div>

Moderately intelligent and gifted with concentration and willpower, Eric was a top contender for the spot of valedictorian until his junior year. For unclear reasons, he failed a physics exam that completely dropped him out of the race. As he never fully chose an objective for himself, and lacking any other clear goal, his determined mindset decidedly faltered. He abandoned his bid for captainship of the debate team and recently began to branch into easier, non-competitive classes. Without the workload of a top student, he found the time to revive the archery club. As not many know of his recent fall from grace, most seniors are still cold with him, viewing him as a threat. He's begun to reconsider his choices at the St. Magnus School.</div>
