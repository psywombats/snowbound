Stuff that's working well:

radio scene
emmanuel, but he needs to be like multiple people
max interacting with not-rebecca
bring back that "where is everyone" budget movie
move the snark around the characters
blackout.
the camp
bullying - should everyone hate marisa?
marisa x eric
rebecca x cait
marisa on the catwalks
engineering!
conference on the 3rd floor
screw max, catch some sleep
money should play in, it's a boarding school
basement lyfe
the under siege atmosphere of the bad route (move it to true route)
theme: tribalism
theme: cooperation only in the face of a greater threat ??? needs an ism
ending on the bridge hahaha
there's weird pacing at around the 7/8 mark on the 2nd to last day
the "crisis moment" in the plan - so make it longer!
the council at the end - don't skip that!!!
bust up the shitty school at the end
should your choices affect character development?


Stuff that blows:

cut down on the weird verbs that are your speech and not the character's
change the school name hahaha
"credit" in general
less proper-sounding nouns ie "linear algebra"
need more exposition of the setting, not just characters (but could use both)
relationship between characters needs to be felt out first
be explicit about time and switchto's
reb's route is eric-centric
be more ~~figurative~~
spend more time on exposition before the event maybe
tedious geography
time delay isn't conveyed well
shikata ga nai wa ne
there needs to be more drivingness on day 1 afternoon
woahh exposition in sid/eric way too early
there needs to be an extra day between 1 and 2... possibly blizzard earlier?
;;;
any and all music shit
"you could stand to lose a few pounds"
getting marisa down
"debate team member"
felix's theory is really too early
"any objections"
"lynched"
there needs to be an extra day between 1 and 2 and between 4 and 5
basically, "we're trapped" mode needs to kick in a day later
and then "we're crazy" mode a day later
reb should exile herself when caught
space out s055
slow down get info -> reason about info
the lock is not explained
bon apetit is a max thing
rewrite the "true end"
the ending plan suxxxx
the final plan should be made by sid and lyra, not just eric and rebecca
every "I'll have someone" should be a person
the day of the attack is very empty
more dialog at the bottom of the stage
deformalize some meetings
arya x pete
tie up some themes at the end
have the MCs take charge at the end!
students -> people
the ending d14 miracle needs to tie into the theme


Character notes:

Rebecca:
needs a narration unique voice
at the end with max, you need to avoid him
be more self-conscious about your optimism
really great manipulative side
you should still be after max on the final "epilogue" day

Max:
pretty cringeworthy
lose some sarcasm
also kind of obvious
you should challenge ken! be more of an opposition when the gym is divided
"my dear" needs to die
you shouldn't be reading people (felix) either
gets weird at the ending, little impersonal (well, loses his core character)
be friends with roleswapped Felix aka genderswapped Lynn

Eric:
stop stuttering
needs more exposition in Reb's scenes
why are you so optimistic?
don't "read" people, that's not your gimmick
needs a job in the end route
**oh god the cheese at the end please shut up

Lyra:
not actually that bad? in the true route though, ughh
cut the denpa shit
she should have a bigger interaction early on
yooo you should help out rebecca on her side
stick up for sophie at the end

Shibin:
way too obvious early on
needs to be consistent
you're called Stephen now
at least hint at what's going on towards the end

Sophie:
kill the swim team
kinda obvious
brighten up a bit at the end, you've found your calling

Henry:
you do your job really well.

Sid:
what's your deal?
he should help in the final true route plan, not just be a "check up" chara
don't talk like a tool

Marisa:
needs character definition
her corpse shouldn't be shuffled around so much, ew

Arya:
needs more speaking time
she should be bad with names
maybe she should stay with Max in the true ending
should be bad with people, or maybe always friendly to a fault?

Felix:
ruuules
needs to be introduced
needs a voice
be a girl?
gender-swapped version should be an artist! or some sort of creative

Cait:
uh a little over the top in the bad end

Marilyn:
swap places with Felix

Ken:
needs more lines at the beginning for characterization
should start out more stable at the opening
team up with reb against max
lose the mental patient amensiac gimmick, /you/ should be the optimist
no doubt your parents are rich
