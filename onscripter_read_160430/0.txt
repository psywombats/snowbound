`There are two types of morning students: those who arrive half an hour early, and those who arrive with half a minute to spare.@ I'm proud to belong to neither camp, and as I'm in the middle, there's hardly anyone on the road at this hour.@ But of course, the one student I'm looking for is right ahead of me.\

`I glare at him.\
`REBECCA: It's too early for this.@ All I notice is that it's cold.@ Some of us just don't have the fairydust sense that you do, Max.\
`MAX: Please, my dear, call me Maximilian.@ 'Max' just rubs doesn't suit my dignified self.\

`This is my fourth year here, meaning I'm an A-rank.@ I still have two years left though: next year as a junior, and finally the nightmare that is senior year...@ I can't say I'm looking forward to it.@ I remember when I first came here as a D-rank, right after the sixth grade.@ Back then, I couldn't wait.@ Now I'm not so sure.\

`Having practiced in the morning, there are quite a few sports groups here.@ There's the track team in the corner.@ There are also the non-sports teams.@ This is the great St.@ Magnus School; there are no clubs, only teams.@ Clubs can't compete, so they're not welcome here.@ There's the math team, and debate as well.@ Most social groups revolve around one team or another.@ I'm a member of no team but archery, and archery isn't really a team at all.\

`And of course, apart from the groups of students and far more alone than me are the select seniors gifted enough to be in contention for top of the class.@ No one comes near them as they sit and study.@ I've always thought maybe I'd like to be one of them, smart enough to become the master of this place, but I only get by on my hard work, not talent.\

`I guess I'd know more if I paid attention to the news, but it seems there's a storm headed our way tomorrow.@ There was one of these last year and we were forced to spend an entire weekend bunkered in the dorm building while there was a light rain outside.@ I'm not looking forward to it.@ I'm not a winter person myself, and adding some rain and wind doesn't seem like it would be overly pleasant.\

`Maximilian and I part ways.@ He's headed off to some abstract algebra class while I'm stuck in European Studies.@ Max might play dumb half the time, but he's working on a legitimate research paper with one of the mathematics professors.@ I've never been quite sure what other talents he may be hiding.\

`I sit through European Studies again.@ I'm glad it's just a boring class and not a challenging one.@ Any more work and I'd be falling apart right about now.@ However, as it's not a challenging class, it's not worth as much credit as the other history classes.@ Each year, the grades office calculates a class's credit worth based on the average grade of the students in that class.@ The higher the average, the less credit each student receives.@ And finally, your personal grade is multiplied by the class's credit worth, and the result is added to your total standings.\

`It's a vicious system.@ I think the grading office designed the system to reward students for taking hard classes, but as it is, it just means that those students who are aiming to have the most credit must take the extremely hard courses to stand a chance, even early on.@ It's not as if I could become top of the class, so I'll stick to classes I can handle, thanks.@ It's also nice being in a class where no one is trying to cut the others down.@ European Studies is easy enough that there aren't many serious students in here.\

`SID: It would be a useful tool to have.@ If breaking open a fire door is a life or death problem, then I'm willing to spend two days on it.\
`LYRA: Won't Felix notice if we start breaking through doors?\

`LYRA: Sure, I could handle that.\
`ERIC: We can't use that as our primary strategy though.@ There has to be some other way.\
`SID: Who came up with this damn fire door concept to begin with?\
`ERIC: We could try searching through the desks at the staff offices on the first and second floors.\
`SID: Felix already searched the English offices.@ You mean search the biology department rooms?\
`ERIC: Right, just like the classrooms.@ Someone must have physical keys to the auditorium basement and the door that leads from the main hall to the catwalks.@ If Felix found the right key, there must be a left key somewhere.\
`SID: I guess, but why would either of those be at the biology offices?\
`ERIC: Who knows.@ I'm just saying we have to keep an eye out for them.\
`LYRA: What about the central office?\
`The central office?@ That's on the first floor, connected to the entrance hall.\
`SID: Both the conference room and main office are locked.\
`ERIC: We could break those little windows that lead to the entry hall and maybe someone slim enough could slip in.\
`We both look at Lyra.\
`LYRA: I knew I'd be helpful.\
`ERIC: But those are glass.@ We'd have to be really careful.\
`SID: It's doable.@ Maybe we could find a master key.\
`ERIC: That gives us two leads then.@ That's enough of a plan for me.\
`SID: I still don't know why you're considering the biology offices a lead.\
`ERIC: Let's put it this way.@ Felix is going to have the students search those rooms sometime this afternoon, right?@ What happens if we take all day to raid the central office and turn up nothing?@ We wouldn't have a chance to go back to the biology offices before Felix retrieves anything useful.\
`SID: Okay, I see your point.\
`LYRA: Haa, I'm hungry...\

`FELIX: I'm not giving up, Eric.@ I was never playing.@ We can't win.@ There is nothing in our power we can do to win this.\
`HENRY: Yeah, I'm at a loss too.@ At least if we're isolated we can rely on our own wits.\
`FELIX: Why, do you still think differently?\
`He takes my lack of response as the affirmative.\
`FELIX: Eric, I'll try to convince you.@ It would be very difficult for us to coexist if you still think of this in terms of winning and losing.\
`ERIC: I don't.@ I think of it in terms of living and dying.@ We've had one casualty so far and one near miss.@ You're the one who seems concerned with how to win, whatever that means.\
`FELIX: Sure, I'll consider our situation in other terms if you want me to.@ It's the same thing.@ What makes your life more important than one of those students in the gym?@ What makes my life more important than yours?\
`ERIC: That's a loaded question.\
`FELIX: That's the point.@ It's a question I refuse to answer.@ I'm not having an existential crisis here, but I'm not so cowardly as to elevate my life above everyone else's.@ I've just placed the collective worth of the twelve students here against the worth of the approximately thirty students in the gym.\
`ERIC: You don't think that's a false dichotomy?\
`HENRY: Do you want to take that chance?\
`ERIC: If you two think you're strong enough to sit and quietly die, that's admirable, but I don't think I can agree.@ As long as there's still a chance of us all surviving, I'll take it.\
`FELIX: You're playing a losing game, Eric.@ We don't even know what winning is.\
`ERIC: Then someone has to figure it out.\
`FELIX: You put up a good defense, and I respect that.@ I'll promise you that if I ever discover what winning in this place means, I will pursue it whole-heartedly.@ Until then, we stay here and find that purpose.\

`CAIT: Look, I'm sorry about this, but I need to live, here.\
`ERIC: We have a water bottle and half a granola bar.@ Now will you let Lyra go?\
`CAIT: You promise?\
`ERIC: You realize we probably would've given it to you anyway, right?@ You sound awful.@ Where are you?@ I can't see a thing.\
`CAIT: Right in front of you.\
`LYRA: You can let go now.@ I have the food around here somewhere...\
`Without the light, I can't see the exchange.\
`CAIT: Thank you so much.@ I haven't had anything to eat or drink in two days.\
`ERIC: You're Cait, aren't you?@ We met on Thursday.\
`CAIT: That's right.\
`ERIC: Where did you come from?@ I mean, how did you get here?@ Weren't you in the gym?@ Or were you like trapped in the hall like Lyra?\
`CAIT: I was in the gym.@ They shut me in the basement, though.@ I could get to both sets of stairs, but I couldn't get out because of those stupid firedoors...@ until someone left the biology hall door open.\
`SID: That would be us...@ I hope we don't regret that.\
`CAIT: You won't.@ I promise, I can be useful.@ I won't make the same mistakes I did last time.\
`ERIC: That's unfortunate, though...@ So there's no one on the other side waiting to open the fire door from the south stairs to the entrance hall?\
`CAIT: No.@ I couldn't get back to the gym even if I wanted to.\
`SID: Damn.\
`ERIC: Maybe we can figure something out though.\
`SID: But that does mean the entire basement is open.@ Couldn't you find anything useful down there?\
`CAIT: There's not a crumb to eat down there.@ Even if there was, some other idiot called Arya stole all the good stuff for herself.\
`SID: Eric, my phone is almost dead.@ I don't know how thorough we can be down there.\
`ERIC: If we go to the physics lab, maybe we can find a real flashlight like Felix has or something.\
`SID: Either way, it's good to have you with us, Cait.@ You've got good info.\
`LYRA: But how'd you get yourself exiled?\
`CAIT: Long story.@ Some kid baited me into a fight and I ended up hurting him pretty badly.@ And the kid that runs the gym, Kenneth, is a real tyrant.@ And a softie.\
`LYRA: You know he can't really be both, but uh...\
`ERIC: How are they doing over there?\
`CAIT: For being run by a dumbass, pretty good.@ They have a ton of food from somewhere, but this Shibin guy keeps it all locked up.\
`SID: Good.\
`ERIC: If you haven't figured it out, we're trying to meet up with them.\
`CAIT: I noticed.@ But what about everyone else?@ Are you the only kids here?@ I thought there were a bunch of you guys in the entrance or something.\
`ERIC: We're split up.@ Depending on the way Felix takes it, maybe permanently.\
`CAIT: What do you mean, split up?\
`SID: We were free to leave, but I'm not sure how happy Felix will be when he realizes we ran off with his knife, a bottle of water, and half a granola bar.\
`CAIT: Uh...\
`She looks down at the crumbs of the granola bar.\
`CAIT: So, bad news: The first floor fire door is the only one that's open.@ I couldn't get through to the second floor.\
`LYRA: What does that mean?\
`SID: Remember, Felix and friends filed through the bolt on the first floor door, but they only propped open the second floor.@ The fact that it's closed now means our disappearance has been noticed.\
`LYRA: I guess Felix isn't very happy.\
`ERIC: That's no good, it means Felix got his way.@ They've completely shut themselves in.@ We don't have any way to contact Marilyn or Henry or anyone else he's trapped in there.@ He's determined to die for the rest of them in the gym.@ It's insane.\
`CAIT: Well that sounds insane.@ From what I hear of that guy, he jumped off the deep end a decade ago.@ You'd have to be brain damaged to make a run for valedictorian.\
`I'm tempted to agree, at this point.\
`ERIC: Well, we can worry about them once we've got some food of our own, and I think the only place we're going to find that is in the gym.\
`SID: And if we can't get to the gym, we'll have to settle for the basement.\
`CAIT: Come on, it's a wasteland down there.@ You're not going to do any better than I did.\
`SID: We still have my phone, so we'll have some light.\
`ERIC: For a bit, anyway.@ And we can still ransack the office.\
`SID: No, we'd need the key from Felix, and he's shut himself in.\
`CAIT: They need to open that door some time, right?@ Maybe then we jump them.@ That could work.\
`I'd like to think that I only imagined the knife flourish.\
`LYRA: That sounds like fun.\
`ERIC: We're not taking their base by storm, Cait.@ This isn't some game.\
`CAIT: Whatever.@ For now I'll listen to you because you gave me food.\
`SID: That sounds like you won't be listening later.\
`CAIT: No, like I said before, I'm not going to screw things up this time.@ Well, what are we doing now?\
`ERIC: Now?@ Just now we were trying to sleep.\
`CAIT: Isn't it cold in here?\
`Yes, this office is freezing, but so is every other place.\
`ERIC: If you have any better ideas, let me know.\
`CAIT: I'd say we could go back to where I slept in the basements.@ It's not much though, and I only have tools there and not supplies.\
`LYRA: We could try lighting a fire.\
`SID: With what?\
`LYRA: It's really cold though.\
`She sneezes.\
`CAIT: Oh please you don't tell me you people are contaminated.@ I didn't come here to pick up some disease.\
`LYRA: It's just a cold, I think.@ I mean, I was alone in that classroom for so long.\
`CAIT: Get over here.@ I'm just taking your temperature, stop squirming\
`I hear movement.@ In my opinion, the lack of light is more annoying than the lack of heat.\
`CAIT: Well, you have a fever anyway.@ What the hell were you doing alone in a classroom?@ Are you dumb?\

`I raise my eyebrows, even though no one will see me.@ It's ironic to consider that Caitlyn is now giving Lyra a portion of the water that she won by holding Lyra hostage.@ Oh well.@ We have one more person to keep alive now, but I think the gain in information outweighs the drain on resources.@ Now that we can access the basement, we're only one fire door away from the gym, and someone could open that door at any time.\

`As we all try to sleep, I go over our schedule for tomorrow.@ Without Felix to fall back on, our position is looking a lot worse.@ There's no going back now.@ Maybe I always knew Felix wouldn't react well to this, but preemptively sealing the entire group off wasn't something I was expecting.@ Rihgt now, we have a mostly empty water cooler tank and no food whatsoever.@ There can't be anyone who isn't hungry.@ At this point, the gym is our only hope.\

`Tuesday, November 15th: Day 5\

`When I wake up, all I know is that I'm cold and stiff.@ The only light is a faint ray shining through the window of an exit door.@ I'm lying on the first floor landing of the south stairwell.@ Last night, I hardly had the will to move.@ All I could do was sit and try to keep myself together.@ How did I turn from one of Kenneth's advisors to an exile?@ I'm doomed, probably.\

`I wonder where Cait is.@ I half hoped she would find me, but at this point, I doubt she'd be friendly with me.@ If I had spoken up for her back on the morning of the trial, maybe she wouldn't be down here now.@ If she feels anything like the disappointment I feel towards Max at the moment, she won't be happy.\

`Maximilian...@ I have his phone now.@ I don't understand why he gave it to me.@ If he wanted to help, couldn't he have stood up to Shibin and freed me?@ Anyway, I don't think I'm helping anything by sitting here and waiting for someone to come and rescue me.@ It's time to find Cait.@ If she hasn't frozen to death by now, she probably knows a thing or two about surviving down here.@ But if she didn't make it...@ I hope I don't find a corpse.\

`Before I leave, I check the door.@ Unsurprisingly, it doesn't budge.@ As I make my way down the stairs, the light from the door fades much too quickly.@ I'm tempted to use Max's phone, but I know the battery won't last much longer.@ If only I had something like Arya's makeshift flashlight...@ Actually, maybe I can find something if I visit the physics lab.@ That's on my immediate right as I pass through the fire door that Arya propped open on the first day.\

`I'm not Arya, though.@ I can find the entrance to the lab, but that's about it.@ How did she construct her device in the dark?@ I'd use the phone, but I've never had any courses down here and I wouldn't know what to do.@ And Arya probably took most of the useful materials anyway.@ Time to head out.\

`This hallway is almost unnavigable.@ When the sound of my footsteps fail to ring as normal, I realize I must be standing where Pete was lying back on that night.@ I keep moving.@ All of the physics and computer labs are on this hallway, but I think they must all be locked.@ I try the handle of the first door on my left, and it swings inwards.@ Someone left this unlocked?@ The crunching of glass under my feet answers the question: someone must have broken the window to gain entry.\

`I'm not sure what I'm looking for.@ Actually, I don't even know if I can look for anything.@ Without light, what am I supposed to do?@ I step on something that I can't identify.@ What was my goal here?@ That's right, I need to find Caitlyn.\

`Wait, that's not right.@ She could be over in the mathematics hallway.@ The doors to the student lounge down here aren't fire doors.@ I retrace my steps and turn left before the south stairwell.@ The door to the student lounge opens noiselessly.@ I usually never go down here as all the couches are occupied most days, but the air in here feels empty.@ The basement is stifling and cold.\

`I'm about ready to find my way across to the room at the other end when I hear two sounds from across the room.@ The first is a creak from the other wooden door, and the second is a footstep.@ When I go to take a step back, I almost fall over an inconveniently placed chair.@ Before I can think, something tackles me back over the chair and onto the floor.\

`REBECCA: Okay, there is a lot we need to go over.\
`SID: No kidding.\
`REBECCA: First of all, what happened to Marisa Montoire?@ If you didn't know, she's dead on the floor in the auditorium.\
`SID: I told Henry we should've put her in the storage room.\
`ERIC: If you wanted to move her, you could've.@ I certainly wasn't going near her.@ That...@ That face.\
`REBECCA: Tell me what happened!@ Everyone upstairs thinks you all killed her, and you're not making it look any better!\
`ERIC: Suicide.@ She hung herself on the second night.\
`REBECCA: You're kidding.@ What would make her do that?@ And I'm not sure I should believe it.\

`CAIT: But how did you end up down here?@ Does this mean the fire door on the first floor landing is open?\
`REBECCA: Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm like you now.@ Exiled.\
`CAIT: What did you do?@ Did you finish Pete off for me?@ Or did you punch in Shibin's swollen head?@ I would love to do that myself, actually.\
`REBECCA: A lot of stuff happened once we found out Marisa was dead.@ Like I said, Shibin and Kenneth are convinced someone killed Marisa and maybe the rest of you, and they want nothing to do with it.@ I'm not sure Max believes it or not, but either way, I tried to convince them not to wall you off.\
`ERIC: Wall us off?@ What do you mean?\
`REBECCA: Pete picked the lock to the door between the catwalks and the main hall.@ That's how we saw Marisa.\
`SID: Then once we have the key from Felix to the other catwalk door, we're free.\
`REBECCA: No, they piled everything in the gym in front of that door.@ It's impassable.@ I tried to help, but long story short, I tried to free you, Cait, and they sent me down here for it.\
`CAIT: Oh.\

`REBECCA: Who said we're basement dwellers?@ Can't we go back out the way you guys came in?\
`ERIC: There's nothing for us in the biology halls.@ All we have up there is a bit of of water.@ This is the last unexplored ground.\
`CAIT: I hate to break it to you, but this isn't unexplored at all.@ I lived down here, remember?@ And so did Arya.\
`ERIC: Fair point.@ But there are more of us now.@ We can search more thoroughly.\
`SID: No one's been to the chemistry hallway on the second floor, right?\
`ERIC: We'd have to break through a fire door to get there, and I'm not sure it's worth the effort.\
`SID: There are definitely a few chemistry professors that kept water and a maybe snacks in their offices, but we'd have to break through a fire door to get there.\
`REBECCA: That's not true.@ You're one door, a barricade, two guards, and a rabid Shibin away from the gym.@ We're exiles.@ Cait stabbed Pete, I tried to help her, and they think the rest of you collectively lynched Marisa.\
`LYRA: What about me?\
`Lyra sneezes into her hand and the candle in Cait's hand flickers.\
`REBECCA: Weren't you in the auditorium?\
`LYRA: No, I ended up in the bio hallway.\
`REBECCA: I don't think it matters where you actually were.@ You were still out of the gym when Marisa died.\
`CAIT: Look at her!@ She's a pathetic freshman with a fever!@ She froze half to death in some abandoned classroom for days and she's had maybe two granola bars and a bottle of water in the past five days!\
`LYRA: I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to do that.\
`ERIC: Do you really think they'd turn her away?\
`REBECCA: Shibin might, but I think Kenneth could overrule him.@ Kenneth isn't a bad person at all, he's just overwhelmed sometimes.@ I don't think there's any way he could kick out Lyra after meeting her though.\
`The issue would be getting her there.@ I know Shibin will never listen to me again, and he's terrified of Eric.\
`SID: Do we really want to use Lyra as a tool to gain entry though?\
`CAIT: I'm not talking about that at all!@ I mean that even if Shibin throws us out, she can stay.@ There's still a reason we should be finding a way into the gym.\
`LYRA: Don't do it just for me.\
`ERIC: No, Cait's right.@ Even if only one of us from this group can make it out, we'll do everything we can to ensure that that happens, okay?\
`LYRA: Thanks.@ I know what it's taken you all to get this far.\
`SID: We're still stuck in a rut here.@ Felix won't take us and Kenneth won't take us.@ What do we do now?\
`ERIC: There's only one thing we can do.@ We need to search this place.@ We need everything we can get.@ From there, we'll try to break through either the first or second floor fire doors.@ The second floor brings us at a bit of food at least, and if we manage to convince Kenneth, we're safe in the gym.\

`We sit down.\
`REBECCA: I've been trying to find time to ask you...@ Why aren't Felix and the rest down here?@ What made him decide to hole up?\
`ERIC: He didn't want to go find the gym students.@ He thought if we split their supplies, they'd all starve.\
`REBECCA: So what?@ He's going to lie down and die?\
`ERIC: No, I think he hopes rescue shows up before they run out.\

`ERIC: You know, you're right.@ Let's say we've got two cases: a late rescue and an early rescue.@ Joining with the gym only hurts if there's a late rescue.@ And he's counting on an early rescue to survive anyway.\
`REBECCA: He seemed like such a rational person, but sometimes I wonder...\
`ERIC: I wasn't aware you knew him much.@ Does it really matter why?@ He's out of the picture for now.\
`REBECCA: I don't know why I care so much.@ I just find it important to understand why people do what they do.\
`ERIC: How about you then?@ What made you walk away from everything in the gym to attempt to help people who, as it turns out, mostly didn't want help to begin with?\
`REBECCA: I don't think I can explain it.@ It kind of frightens me.\
`ERIC: Maybe I understand.@ We both have a bit of Felix in us.@ We're trying to get as many people through this alive as possible without thinking too much about ourselves.\
`REBECCA: But if you wanted to do that, why didn't you stay with Felix?\
`ERIC: He took it too far.@ He's condemning the students in debate and jazz that are counting on him.@ I couldn't go along with that.\
`REBECCA: And I couldn't stand Shibin's barricade.@ Maybe that's it.\
`We stare in silence for a few moments.\
`REBECCA: When you said 'as many people alive as possible,' were you referring to Marisa?\
`I can't come up with a response.\
`REBECCA: I'm sorry.@ I know she was important to you.\
`ERIC: Don't be.@ Maybe it was no one's fault, maybe it was mine.\
`REBECCA: Saying that never helps anything.\
`ERIC: You say you understand people.@ Then tell me, did she commit suicide because she was sick of living, because she followed Felix's dont't-consume-resources philosophy, or did she do it just to spite us all?\
`REBECCA: No one can know that now.\
`ERIC: Maybe it was some mixture of them all...\
`REBECCA: What was ever between you two?@ She was always your fencing partner last year, every single time.@ I never saw one of you without the other.@ And this year, she quit the team.@ And don't think I haven't seen that you've changed.@ The person I'm talking with now is definitely not Eric Larsen from last year.\
`When I'm quiet, she takes a deep breath and contines.\
`REBECCA: If this were one year ago, you would never be down here with Lyra and Sid and no food.@ You would be here alone and with everything of Felix's you could get your hands on.@ You changed.@ Marisa noticed.@ Did she hate you for it?\
`ERIC: No, it's the other way around.@ She caused that change.\
`REBECCA: Huh.@ Maybe that was her plan.@ She did it, then.\
`ERIC: Did it?@ What does that even mean?@ I'm the way I am now because I'm not in the standings for valedictorian any more.@ She tricked me into missing an exam and I failed the course.@ That's all there is.@ If you mean she succeeded in academically murdering me, yeah, you're right.@ She definitely did that.\
`REBECCA: Is it all that bad to be academically dead?\
`You have no idea how much I wish I knew.@ I've been uncomfortable thinking about it before, but now talking with Rebecca it all seems to be falling into place.\
`ERIC: You mean you think she meant to change me from what I was then into what I am now?\
`REBECCA: I never knew her.@ Maybe it was a side effect.@ But if it was ever what she wanted, she certainly did it.@ Did you know that Max and I almost didn't come back to fencing after Emmanuel graduated?@ We thought you'd be the captain from hell, practices every day, that sort of thing.\
`ERIC: I used to think Emmanuel was out of his mind, but on this side of the line it's so much easier to see where he was coming from.\
`The former captain of the fencing team...@ He didn't need to fail a class to see that there were more important things than top of the standings.\

`CAIT: Henry promised...@ He said he just needed you out of the way for an hour so he could deal with Shibin.@ Call me an idiot.@ I should never have believed him.@ He promised that when they had the food, I'd be one of the five to live...@ How could I ever buy into that?\
`REBECCA: Cait, we don't hate you.\
`CAIT: You should.@ You're both idiots.@ It's obvious that I'm a horrible person.@ Why did you trust me in the first place?@ I'm the reason you're shut in there.@ You were dumb enough to trust me, even after I stabbed some kid and took a hostage.@ Why would you ever trust me?\
`ERIC: Calm down a minute.\
`CAIT: I'm not going to calm down.@ Even though I was a coward and a traitor I'm still going to die.@ We're all going to die now, so no, I won't calm down.@ How can you be so chill about it?\
`ERIC: Sure, maybe we are going to die.@ At least we put up a fight.@ It could be a lot worse.\
`CAIT: Easy for you to say.@ Did you ever care from the beginning?@ I cared.@ I tried my hardest to make sure I would come out on top.@ I was so scared of this, and now look where I am.@ If I would live, everything would have been justified, but now I'm reduced to this.@ Can you at least give me the satisfaction of hating me?\

`CAIT: I can't tell, I can't tell.@ All I know is that Pete was working with him and Shibin was captured as well.@ They dumped him somewhere else and wrapped him up in duct tape.\
`ERIC: But what happened to you?\
`CAIT: I went to sleep on the night I shut you guys in there.@ Then I woke up to Henry calling me insane while taping my arms together.@ I bit him, but it didn't do too much.@ I think Pete wanted to taunt me a bit so he stopped Henry from taping over my mouth.@ But after that, they just left me in the basement.@ I heard people moving back and forth, but I couldn't see.@ They took the water cooler and the candles.\
`REBECCA: What about Lyra and Sid?\
`CAIT: Maybe they got away.@ I don't know.@ I haven't seen them.@ They dragged me here last night with a few other people.@ Shibin was one of them.@ They brought us up the north stairs and through the biology offices.\
`REBECCA: Pete must've picked the lock...\
`CAIT: Exactly.@ I think the kids in the gym are in big trouble though.@ Last I heard, someone managed to warn them and they closed the fire door before any of Felix's guys got inside.@ But I hear noises.@ They're breaking through the drywall.@ They have some sort of metal bar ram that's breaking through.\
`ERIC: That must be Henry's doing.@ We used the same system to break through the glass walls in the entrance hall.\
`REBECCA: How long could they have been planning this...?\
`ERIC: It's not worth wondering.@ Cait, is there anything more you can tell us?\
`CAIT: No.@ I hope I've made up for something, anyway.@ It's not like it matters anymore.\

`HENRY: Pete's right.@ Felix hasn't announced what the next step is.@ He's been pooling our ideas.@ That's how we ended up with the battering ram strategy, but now we don't have a ram.@ And they're probably better prepared, anyway.\
`ERIC: What exactly is Felix doing in the office, by the way?\
`HENRY: Oh...@ Touchy subject.@ Marilyn is really sick and no one can figure out why.@ She's been that way for a while now and Felix is really attached to her.\

`MAX: If Felix came up to us and said 'Hi, I'm done and I'll leave you alone now,' then I'd have no problem with letting him go free.@ However, I don't think it'll play out like that.@ He'll come here and say 'I'm very sorry Maximilian, I was wrong all along, and won't you let me inside?' And there's no way I can accept that.@ It's simply too unsafe.\
`REBECCA: You'd let him die?\
`MAX: Rebecca, I've realized that being in charge means that we have to bite the bullet every once in a while.@ If Felix and the ten students sorry enough to join up with him have to perish for us in the gym to continue living until rescue arrives, then that's the way it has to be.\
`REBECCA: That's what I don't understand, Max.@ You're already dismissing the fact that we could all coexist.\
`MAX: Because it's ridiculous.@ This is Felix Salazar we're talking about here.@ I know I've joked about Eric Larsen doing anything to get what he wants done, but Felix never gives up.@ And I mean never.@ Asking him to abandon something he thinks is right is pointless.@ Felix would never offer to surrender like that.@ He would rather die.\
`REBECCA: Let's say Felix dies and puts Eric in charge.\
`Would Eric dispose of Felix to save his team?\
`MAX: Then I'd say he has more balls than I thought.\
`REBECCA: But would you accept his surrender and let him in?\

`HENRY: The ram is just a ruse.@ When they spring out of that fire door, we'll be ready.@ We're just going to have two people man the ram, and the rest will storm the gym when they open the door.@ We have superior arms and we should be able to overpower them.\

`When I wake up, the light outside has yet to arrive.@ The gymnasium is still as dark as last night.@ I sit up.@ Around me, no one is moving.@ The only noise is the muffled conversation of the two guards.@ I stand up and stretch.@ Is there anything I need to do today?@ I don't think so.@ Even so, I feel the adrenaline if I so much as think about tonight's schedule.@ That's right, I need to tell Max about the open fire door.@ \

`Thursday, November 23rd: Day 13\

`I wake up tired from the debate last night.@ Convincing Felix of anything takes hours, but Rebecca and I finally made our point.@ Today promises to be a melancholy day.@ Max insisted that we wait one more day before departing in order to search the rest of the school and gather our supplies in one place.@ I can't disagree with him, but I'm not looking forward to the preparations.\

`Rebecca is next to me, still asleep.@ I stand up and survey the beginnings of today's chores in the gray dawn.@ Shibin stands at the side of the gym.@ He has the boxes of supplies down from the stacks, and he and Henry are busy counting, sorting, and packing.@ That must be the biggest job.@ Our largest single source of supplies is still the remainder of the hurricane shelter.@ The fire door opens.@ I notice that no one is guarding it before Sid steps in from the hall.@ I walk over to join him.\

`We spend our morning and afternoon trying to combine the abandoned battering ram of a table and the other stage curtain.@ At this point, Pete's duct tape is in short supply, and we end up searching the classrooms for more materials.@ Along the way, we run into other students doing their last errands as well as others just wandering around to kill the time.@ Felix's group almost universally fall into the latter category.\

`The entire English hall is marked by snow.@ Pete and a few other diggers spent the morning and some of last night tunneling out through the packed snow that blocked the roof door.@ Now, only one student sits outside, keeping the path clear.\

`Back down in our gym workshop, everyone is fully awake and moving around.@ All of the backpacks from the locker rooms are now lined up against one wall.@ Shibin and Max are overseeing the filling of the bags with every manner of supply that has been scavenged from the school.@ The combined blankets from our basement hideout and Felix's staff lounge base are being folded and distributed, and I notice someone grabbed our curtains scraps and threw them into the mix.@ I'm still amazed at the productivity of such a disorganized group of people.\

`Dinner is paltry.@ There are a few dissatisfied grumblings about the size of the handouts, but everyone knows Shibin performed some vague calculation about days and distances to calculate the total amount of supplies allotted to each student and how much to be consumed on a daily basis.@ Tonight is to be the last organized meal.@ All the other food and water is stuffed into the backpacks and makeshift bags.@ Kenneth makes an announcement regarding the recommended ration size, but from now on, how much we eat is our own business.@ \

`The only remaining task after the meal is the construction of a tent.@ Under Arya's direction, it only takes a short while to combine wooden beams, the majority of the scraps from the stage curtains, and a variety of binding materials into a short and cramped structure.@ It stands alone in the middle of the gym for about an hour before the light starts fading, and a few students roll it into a bundle.@ The tent should be large enough to fit all thirty or forty students present, but uncomfortably huddled.@ The warmth will be the best we can get out in the snow if we have to travel multiple days.@ The way everyone, especially Max, seems to be thinking is that that will definitely be the case.\

`We'll wait until the morning to put the sleeping bags with the bags, but Rebecca, Arya, and I mount the tent to a holder on the bottom of the stretcher.@ With Felix and Sophie's help, we transfer Marilyn to the stretcher, where she'll spend the night.@ The construction of the tent required most of her bedding anyway.\

`As the light finally fades, none of us bother with any form of artificial illumination.@ All that remains to be done is bundle the sleeping bags and leave.@ The passage is clear, the supplies are ready, and our minds are decided.@ Tonight is our last night in the St.@ Magnus School.\

`Friday, November 24th: Day 14\

`Most of this morning passes without incident.@ We all know what needs to happen.@ We're all up by the first light.@ There isn't much conversation.@ Everyone rolls their sleeping bags and grabs a backpack.@ Of course, the number of prepared items is exact.@ Felix and Sophie each take one end of Marilyn's stretcher.@ When everyone is prepared, Kenneth opens the fire door to the gym hallway.\

`The group follows the same circuitous route Eric and I followed yesterday.@ Down the south stairs, across the student lounge, up the north stairs, through the staff office...@ Max and Kenneth lead the way while Cait and Shibin bring up the rear.@ For my part, I stand towards the back of the group of us crowding around the cleared passage in the snow.@ Eric is right beside me.@ Our hands are together.\

`One by one, the students climb the carved stairwell in the packed snow into the light snow above.@ The wind and air and sun are beautiful.@ We set out towards civilization, if it still exists out there.@ Around me, the faces blur and run as we walk and walk and walk.@ However, there is one person by my side who never changes, and together we go forth into whatever remains of the world outside.\

`FELIX: Let me start from the beginning here.@ I think we have enough stores to hold out at least twenty days.\

`That's an optimistic estimate.@ I'd say we have three days of uncomfortable living before we're out of food and water.\
`ERIC: No, I understand.@ We don't know how long we have to be here, so every person that has to be supported is a liability.@ Of course, we can't very well get rid of people.\
`SID: Then wouldn't our best move be to find a way into the gym?@ They should have much more than us in terms of supplies.\
`FELIX: But what reason would they have for letting us in?@ It's exactly like what just happened here.@ If they can't communicate with us, they won't feel any moral obligation to help us.@ Depending on how long we'll be stuck here, their chance of survival goes down for every one of us they choose to help.@ We don't bring anything to the table.\
`MARILYN: We're students here, just like them.@ Why wouldn't they help us?\
`FELIX: Let's say, for example, it will take two weeks for help to arrive.@ In this school, there are supplies that will sustain, say, ten people for those two weeks.@ That doesn't mean that ten students will survive.@ If more than ten students eat through the supplies, everyone dies.@ None of these hypothetical students know how long they're trapped for, so they split the supplies and all go hungry in the end.\
`MARILYN: But what can they do?@ They can't possibly know how many can make it, and even if they did, would they just sentence everyone but the ten chosen students to die?\
`My head starts racing without my control.@ Could Marisa have been thinking along these lines?@ No.@ I have to forget about her.\
`FELIX: That's why our situation is unique.@ We're split up.@ We know there's another group with a much larger portion of food and water out there.@ If we join them, we're just another drag on their resources.@ We might all be doomed to die already, but if we find them and they help us, we might just be killing them as well.\
`HENRY: You know, it never occurred to me before that we might not make it out.@ Did everyone forget about us?\
`FELIX: If help hasn't arrived by now, something very bad is going on in the outside world.@ There's no way for us to know what that is as we're completely cut off.@ Because we can't frame any sort of estimate for escape, we have no way to ration properly.@ Planning-wise, this is the worst possible situation.\
`SID: I still don't see why we shouldn't be actively trying to contact the group of students in the gym.@ In all likelihood, they could last a month down here.@ And they have half of the track team and the fencing team already.@ We're only a dozen people.@ Would we really affect them that much?\
`FELIX: Who knows?@ That's what I'm talking about when I say it's impossible to plan.\
`SID: But it's clear that we'll die if we stay here.\
`FELIX: I don't understand.\
`ERIC: No, I get it Sid.@ We could stay here and die when our supplies run out, or we could join the gym and potentially die when their supplies run out.@ You said yourself that they have much more than we do.@ Which choice extends our lifespan?\
`FELIX: That potentially dooms our benefactors.\
`MARILYN: I couldn't live with that on my conscience.\
`SID: And what if a day after we all starve here, the rescue team shows up?@ What would they think?@ They would wonder why this obstinate group of kids chose to rot here instead of saving themselves.\
`HENRY: But it's like Felix says.@ The rescue team might not exist.\
`ERIC: Then whether we join up or not, we're all going to die.\

`Our debate continues into the night with no consensus in sight.@ A few of the other students attempt to make their point, but most gradually settle in the middle of the room in the growing nest of curtain, cushions, and warm bodies.@ The temperature is hovering around freezing.@ It's becoming apparent how low I'm running.@ Over time, the dizziness and fatigue and cold start adding up, and I find somewhere comfortable to spend the night.@ They voices of Felix and Henry are all I hear now.@ Sleep comes quickly.\

`MAX: He very politely asked me to hand over all the supplies in the gym, and that I was welcome to join him in the second floor staff lounge if I was so inclined.@ I told him he could go suck a goat nipple and slammed the door on him.@ It may have been a mistake.\
`LYRA: No, it was worth it.\
`MAX: That's when the attacks started.@ The two students who ventured outside past that point never made it back.@ We kept two guards on the shut door at all times.@ Once, we took a scouting party and made it out to the main hall.@ That's when we figured out that Pete Sai had betrayed us.@ He was busy re-locking the door to the biology offices.@ He managed to scramble inside, and I guess he had backup, because we couldn't pull the door open and he managed to lock it from the other side.\
`ERIC: How did they contact him?\
`REBECCA: If the barricade wasn't broken, it must've been through the basements.\
`ERIC: I guess Henry wasn't just at our doorstep just for peaceful purposes.\
`REBECCA: I understand why he sent me after Caitlyn now...@ There was something already going on.@ We should've asked Cait if she had seen Pete any of the time that she was in the basements.\
`MAX: Over the next day, the battle was at the barricade.@ We didn't dare venture into the main hall because of their spears, and we only realized they were breaking the barricade at the last minute.@ It was a drawn-out process, but I'm afraid we lost.@ Somewhere along the way, Arya disappeared.@ I guess she was taken too.@ She was the best engineer we had and the barricade was her creation.@ After that, we didn't dare leave the gym.\
`ERIC: How about Henry's battering ram?\
`MAX: Oh, that?@ That was an extremely close call.@ They may be more heavily armed than us, but we outnumber them.@ When we realized what they were doing, I organized a mass charge down the hall to drive them back.\
`SOPHIE: I heard it from in here.@ Max was very brave.@ \
`MAX: More like my underlings had nothing to lose.@ Felix gave the order to retreat and they vanished back through the biology office, and we retreated back to the gym.@ We're in a bad spot.@ We can't keep them from smashing through walls for long.@ If you've inspected their point of attack, we've taken serious damage.\
`ERIC: What's your plan?\
`MAX: That's the thing, Eric.@ I don't have one.@ However, I refuse to surrender.\
`ERIC: Refuse to surrender what?\
`MAX: I'm not cutting a deal with him.\
`ERIC: Why not?\
`REBECCA: Remember what happened to Cait when she cut a deal with Felix?\
`MAX: You ran into Cait?\
`REBECCA: Someone working for Felix left her bound in duct tape outside our door.@ She was under the impression she would be one of the chosen ones if she shut us in that stairwell.\
`MAX: Once he's made up his mind, I'm sure he'll backstab us as soon as the opportunity presents itself.@ And I'm not sure how I'm supposed to forgive someone for causing pretty much all of the chaos around here in the last couple days.\
`ERIC: Maybe we can help then.@ While we were still thinking about escape, we sort of had a plan.@ I join up with Felix.\
`MAX: What makes you so sure he'll take you in?@ Didn't he lock you out of the way?@ I thought you were smarter than that.\
`ERIC: He approached us while we were locked in, on the first day.@ He said I was welcome to help him.\
`MAX: And you want to take advantage of that...@ I see.@ It might be our only shot, really.\
`ERIC: Exactly.@ And Rebecca was going to stay here to advise Kenneth.@ But I guess because you're here, that might not be needed.\
`I'm not sure if he's implying that I'm useless or if he wants me to come with him, but either way...\

`REBECCA: Look, what do you see as the best way out of this?@ Do we just have to let Felix and Henry and the kids that joined up with them die?\
`ERIC: If it saves everyone in the gymnasium, do we have a choice?\
`I'm about to contradict him when he interrupts.\
`ERIC: No, I can't do that.@ If I could live with that I would've supported Felix back when we first met up.\
`REBECCA: I agree.@ Maybe there's something stupid in both of us that refuses to make those trades.\
`ERIC: If you told me that dooming Felix's supporters to die would guarantee that we survived, I think I'd have to accept, but as it stands, there's no way we can know what will happen.\
`REBECCA: Then what's our ideal scenario?@ What are we doing here?\
`ERIC: I don't know.@ Why are you asking me away from Max and the rest?\
`REBECCA: Because I've decided I'm not going to blindly follow Maximilian any more.@ He does what he sees as right, and I will do the same.@ He tried to teach me that earlier, but I ignored him.@ So now I'm setting that straight.@ Right now, you're the only ally I have.@ We share views.\
`ERIC: Right, Max said he was unwilling to compromise with Felix.\
`REBECCA: We both have our work cut out for his.@ What if we could forge an alliance between the groups?\
`ERIC: That seems like such a remote chance, but if there's any hope, I'll take it.\
`REBECCA: My thoughts exactly.\
`ERIC: How long could we last, all forty students cooped up in the gym with the shelter supplies?@ I don't know how much there is down there.\
`REBECCA: I don't think we could last as long as Felix's goal of the entire winter...\
`ERIC: But enough to last for a few weeks, anyway.\
`REBECCA: And if rescue doesn't arrive by then, we would all die anyway.@ But promise me one thing...@ After we've split up, meet on the catwalks tomorrow night.\
`ERIC: I can do that.@ Well, we have our goal.@ Can I count on you to do your best to carry it through?\
`REBECCA: I'd never let you down.\
`ERIC: Then I'll do my best as well.\


`We return to Max, Sophie, and Lyra.@ I'm apprehensive about the idea of splitting up again.@ There is a finite chance that we'll never see each other again.@ How much time could we last in the gym, staving off Felix?@ No, I can't think like that.@ We came in to this with the objective of saving as many students as possible, even those attacking us.@ In all likelihood, we'll be paying the price for that.\

`MAX: It's worth it.@ Maybe we can make something out of the glass.@ Right now, there's no way we can combat those spears.\
`REBECCA: Spears?\
`MAX: Most of Felix's crew are carrying half a pair of scissors duct taped to a piece of wood or something.@ We've had to treat a few wounds already, and it wasn't pretty.@ The scissors are blunt, so cutting isn't effective, but those things could easily kill with a good stab.\
`REBECCA: If you say.@ I'll find something to do while you tend to business.\

`For some reason I feel that something is wrong.@ Max just doesn't feel like the Max I know.@ Maybe I never expected him to be the type of person to take charge in a time of crisis.@ Or it could just be that the atmosphere in the gym is so different from that camping feeling I had the very first night.@ If only I had known it would come to this.\

`As I think about the plan Eric and I developed, I realize how hard this will be.@ It looks like Max's group is very well secured.@ There's only one entrance to the gym, and they've taken the battering ram.@ If I were to stay put, it's likely that Felix will never mount another attack.@ How am I supposed to convince Max to make a treaty with an enemy that, if he plans correctly, he will never see again?@ \

`I walk up and down the littered track, trying to find some plan of action.@ With Eric at the pool, everything seemed so clear-cut.@ Now my objective is a lot hazier.@ What could I possibly do that would lead to every student gathered peacefully in the gym when each side is building up an arsenal of murderous weapons?@ I find Max again.\

`ERIC: So he's sacrificing your moral misgivings to get you through alive...\
`MARILYN: I thought maybe with you in the gym, they'd stand more of a chance.@ We all know that with you, Felix, and Henry over here and Arya and Shibin out of commission in the gym, it's only a matter of time before Felix gets what he wants.\

`PETE: To be honest, no one was expecting you guys to be able to repel that attack.@ We weren't expecting retaliation, just a few curious students, and hopefully Max along with them.\
`REBECCA: Max is too smart for you.@ He was expecting a battering ram before we even heard the crashing.@ What else was Felix going to do?\
`PETE: It was a good plan to swarm us.@ Just one or two of you, and I could've cut them in half.\

`PETE: Thanks for your opinion.\

`ERIC: I was wondering when you'd give me an assignment.\
`FELIX: I want you to be my operational commander.\
`ERIC: What?\
`FELIX: I'm not a front-line man, Eric.@ I'm not an improviser like you.@ My strategies are always long term, and I want someone else leading the students when we make our final assault.@ That's why I recruited you.\
`ERIC: I'm flattered, but I really can't do that, Felix.\
`It's true, for more reasons than one.\
`FELIX: Oh really?\
`ERIC: Isn't Henry more qualified?\
`FELIX: In theory, maybe, but I want him on the battering ram.@ I still don't fully trust Arya to do the job by herself.@ I was thinking you'd lead defense forces while Henry supervised the ram.\
`ERIC: Did you take back the ram?\
`FELIX: No, and it's going to take us a bit of time to recover.@ It was a costly mistake.@ Splitting leadership between defense and ram should stop that problem if we have it again.@ We'll be prepared.\
`ERIC: And what if they successfully counterattack again?\
`FELIX: I'm not following these hypotheticals, Eric.@ What's the problem?\
`ERIC: What happens if we fail, Felix?@ If Max plays smart, he could keep us at bay for a very long time.\
`FELIX: Continue.\
`ERIC: Do you remember when you said that you'd change your course of action if you said you found a reason to survive?\
`FELIX: I remember that promise, and I've kept it as well.@ I've found something to chase after, and I've found why our lives are more valuable than theirs.@ They are all wasting their lives down there, Eric.\
`ERIC: In what way?\
`FELIX: They'll all die.@ It's such a huge waste.@ It's a giant tragedy, really.@ Why did such a large group end up with the food?@ What a cruel twist of fate.@ We have no choice but to take it by force.\
`Felix's reasoning is sound, but his words are unusually cruel.\
`FELIX: And I've found someone who deserves to live, Eric.@ Even if she's the only survivor, I can die knowing that what I did was just.\
`I can certainly think of someone like that, but that's an issue for another time.\
`ERIC: In that case, could you make another promise for me?@ If you agree, I'll supervise the defense forces for you.\
`FELIX: Request away, but I make no guarantees.\
`ERIC: If Max strikes some decisive victory and it becomes clear that no one on your side will survive, would you cut a deal with him?@ Would you surrender?\
`FELIX: I can't envision such a situation happening.@ Why would Max humiliate me like that in my final moments?\
`ERIC: Max considers himself a gentleman.@ What if the price of survival was your humiliation?\
`He sighs.\
`FELIX: I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't.@ Yes, I guarantee it.@ If that ever happens, I'll surrender to Max for our survival.@ It's only logical, but it feels so...@ beneath me.\

`SID: Again, let me know if I can do anything for you.\
`ERIC: I won't get you involved unless it's absolutely necessary.@ If anyone from the English hall side sees you, we're both going to be in for a bit of trouble.\

`ERIC: Rebecca?\
`REBECCA: Eric, you're safe.\
`ERIC: It's good to hear your voice.\
`I hear her footsteps echo down the catwalk and we embrace at the center of the stage.\
`ERIC: Everything's well in the gym?\
`REBECCA: Better than I expected.@ You want me to report first?\
`ERIC: Why not?\
`REBECCA: It looks like Kenneth is completely unhinged.@ He didn't recognize me and he thought Max was Shibin.@ Something's not right with him.\
`ERIC: That's not good.@ So Max is really in charge, then.\
`REBECCA: He's the boss, and he's very paranoid.\
`ERIC: He should be.@ Felix is closing in.\
`REBECCA: I couldn't convince Max to compromise.@ Even if Felix surrenders, Max won't accept it.\
`ERIC: I don't think Felix is going to be surrendering any time soon, and if Felix wins control of the gym, it's all over.\
`REBECCA: What can we do, then?@ I have a few ideas, but...\
`ERIC: I opened the basement fire door to the south stairwell.@ If Max wanted to, I think he could trap Felix's crew in the staff lounge.@ But the way Arya and Henry are scheming, they'll have taken this place by tomorrow night.\
`REBECCA: We need to work out some sort of draw.@ Right now, things are really volatile and it could go either way.@ I think I know some way we can have the gymnasium group at least listen to us, but...\
`ERIC: What were you planning?\
`REBECCA: You act as if you've completely joined Felix's cause, and then you capture me.\
`ERIC: Capture you?\
`REBECCA: You take me hostage.@ You say that you'll trade me for Max.@ He'll take it.@ He wouldn't be able to resist.\
`ERIC: Then what?\
`REBECCA: Kenneth is left to lead the gym.@ We could easily press him into accepting some sort of bargain.@ That kid is unstable.\
`ERIC: Okay, but once Felix has Max, the gym students stand no chance against Felix and Henry and Arya.\
`REBECCA: Right.@ That's why it won't work.@ I'm sorry, but it's all I've got.\
`ERIC: What if we matched our plans together?\
`REBECCA: You mean we trap Felix just as Max surrenders?@ How does that work?\
`ERIC: Henry and Arya are planning the attack for tomorrow night.@ We stop them right here, on the catwalks.@ I'll pretend to be on their side and I'll barter with Max then and there.@ However, most of the gym students have already circled around and trapped Felix's group on the catwalks.@ Felix told me he'll surrender if the situation is hopeless.@ Trapped in the auditorium is exactly that: hopeless.\
`REBECCA: It could work...@ So we tell Max that the plan is for him to lead a small segment of students to the front and the rest circle around?@ And then you 'capture' me and hold him up at the front?\
`ERIC: Right, and it holds up Felix as well.@ Then, once Max is out of the way, Kenneth will accept Felix's surrender.\
`REBECCA: It sounds ridiculous, but it's the closest thing to plan we have, so we have to try.\
`ERIC: If we screw it up, the balance of power will swing wildly in one direction.@ One side will crush the other.\
`REBECCA: That'll happen no matter what we do.@ This position can't last forever.\
`ERIC: Right...@ Then we both know what to do?\
`REBECCA: I think.@ What time do you think Felix will try to attack?\
`ERIC: I can convince him to choose midnight.@ That's a time that we can both find.\
`REBECCA: It looks like it.@ Okay, I'll be right here when you come with Felix's crew, then you step forward and take me hostage.\
`ERIC: I can explain my half of the plot to Felix.@ Of course, without letting him know he's being pincered.\
`REBECCA: Right, he'll see the logic in disposing of Max.\
`ERIC: Well...@ I should report back to Felix on the scouting.\

`December 11th, Day 1\

`'...and 9 to 17 inches of snow expected overnight in the Valdez area, and whiteout warnings reported for Cordova, Anchorage and the entire south-central region.@ Stay tuned for more weather alerts from KEC43...'\

`REBECCA: Damn it.@ I don't want to walk home in the snow.\
`SOPHIE: Is that a radio?\
`REBECCA: No, a cell phone, but it doubles as a radio if you find the right radio websites.\
`SOPHIE: You probably know you're not allowed to have those in here, and it's really not worth the effort to tell you off...\
`REBECCA: It's not my phone.@ Max lent it to me.\
`SOPHIE: Why is it always Max that instigates these things?@ What're you using it for anyway?\
`REBECCA: For once Max wasn't lying when he said there'd be a blizzard.\
`SOPHIE: Only 9 inches of snow, though.@ It'll all be gone by Monday anyway, so there's really no hope of any more snow days.\
`REBECCA: But there was a whiteout warning.@ How long does that last?\
`SOPHIE: Are you sure?@ Let me listen to this.\

`Sophie and I are sitting in the back of the main hall of the St.@ Magnus Academy for Young Researchers.@ It's my only study this week in an otherwise hellish schedule.@ There are advantages to attending the top-ranked sciences high school in the country, but being surrounded by much more intelligent people is a bit of a drawback.@ I should be reading this tome in front of me, but Sophie and I stay fixed on the phone radio.\

`SOPHIE: Are you still a part of that fencing team?\
`That's nostalgic.\
`REBECCA: Nope, that team's long gone.@ The captain graduated last year.\
`SOPHIE: Well if it still existed, this would be the first meeting day.@ And the meeting would be canceled.\
`REBECCA: Probably.\
`SOPHIE: I guess it's not surprising that no one decided to continue the team this year.@ You guys never stood a chance of earning credit.\

`Ah, the infamous credit system of the St.@ Magnus Academy.@ All of the extracurricular programs here count towards class rank.@ The school has a reputation to uphold, so we're incentivized to win on the rare occasions we make it out of the wilderness to an athletic or musical competition.@ Who would want to captain a team that stood no chance of earning credit?\

`MAX: Hey, how's it going?\
`I was wondering how long it'd take him to show up.\
`REBECCA: Max!@ I checked the weather station and it looks like there's at least a foot of snow on the way, plus whiteout conditions.@ You were right for once.\
`SOPHIE: What're you doing here?@ Aren't you supposed to be in linear algebra?\
`MAX: I left as soon as the problem set was assigned.@ Everyone's too busy falling over themselves about the snow to care anyway.\
`SOPHIE: Hmph.\
`And now it's about to start.@ The Max-Sophie cycle of abuse never ceases to irritate me.\
`MAX: If I can keep the grades, there's nothing wrong with it.\
`SOPHIE: I doubt someone like you is exactly at the top of the class.\
`MAX: Maybe I am.@ Maybe you're jealous.\
`SOPHIE: Fine, fine.@ I'll go sit somewhere else.\
`MAX: What's with her?\
`REBECCA: Don't play dumb.@ It really doesn't suit you.\
`MAX: Ah well, she's boring to be around anyway.\
`REBECCA: Are you really at the top of the class, though?\
`MAX: Me?\
`REBECCA: That's quite a suspicious look on your face.\

`It's another inevitable part of the St.@ Magnus culture.@ The valedictorian here practically has their choice of any university in the country.@ The competition among the top-tier students is insane, so I doubt Max would be able to keep a secret like that.@ Then again, it's common practice to hide one's grades.@ I remember that notebook I used to keep freshman year, back when I still thought I was smart...@ Now, two years later, I realize I never stood a chance.\

`MAX: Nope, not me.@ I'm a horrible student and I don't know why they let me in here.\
`REBECCA: You're in linear algebra a year early, and you're taking that analysis class as well.@ You're not dumb.\
`MAX: Sometimes I wonder.\

`Maximilian Wolf is certainly not dumb.@ He's been a mystery since I met him freshman year, but I never thought he was stupid.@ He puts on a show, but his math skills are about five years above mine.@ I figure most people out after talking to them for a while, but never Max.@ Maybe that's why I tolerate him.\

`MAX: Snap out of it, my dear.@ The weather's back on.\
`REBECCA: Don't call me 'my dear.' You know that's annoying.\
`MAX: Then I insist that you call me 'Maximilian' from now on.\
`REBECCA: I'm not going to call you -@ \
`MAX: Shh, the radio's on.@ \

`'...again, whiteout warnings issued for north of Cordova all the way north to -@ '\

`MAX: Did you turn it off?\
`REBECCA: No, of course not.@ It just shut off.@ Did it lose signal or something?\
`MAX: It must've been the fairies.\
`REBECCA: Funny.@ You're not concerned about this at all?\
`MAX: Not really.@ Fairies are an everyday occurrence that we must all learn to embrace.\
`REBECCA: Stop it, this could be serious.\
`MAX: You need to calm bit.@ Are you stressed, my dear?\
`REBECCA: Forget it.\

`He sighs.@ I swear I'm not usually on edge like this, but something seems off today.@ Most storms are just an inconvenience, an extra obstacle in the half mile to the dorms building.@ Max jokes that every storm's a blizzard, but I wish he would take me seriously.@ Or maybe he does and I just can't tell.\

`It's 4 o'clock, not that the night outside ever changes.@ I can see the first flakes in the lamps that light the entry road.@ Whatever chatter in the hall is all about the weekend, never mind the snow.@ A few students are even leaving already.@ Sophie is sulking over at the far end, and as I look around the room for Max, I spy someone who doesn't belong.\

`ERIC: Rebecca?\
`Eric Larsen: senior, contender for valedictorian, and a former teammate on the old fencing team.\
`REBECCA: Eric, what're you here about?\
`If he's trying to be top of the class, I wouldn't think he's in a study period, and even less likely to skip.\
`ERIC: Are you coming to the fencing meeting this afternoon?\
`REBECCA: Eric, Emmanuel graduated, remember?@ There's no captain.@ We're over.\
`ERIC: I'm the senior on the team now.@ I'm captain.\
`REBECCA: We don't even have enough members for a team.@ Emmanuel graduated, Max is probably too lazy to do it again, and Marisa quit at the end of last year.@ Are you going to win them back or something?\
`ERIC: Marisa's long gone, but it doesn't matter.@ We're recruiting, and I put up some fliers.@ Sid's joining this year as well.\
`SID: Hey.\
`I don't know him, except that he showed up to watch practice once or twice last year.\
`REBECCA: Look, Eric, we were the most dysfunctional team ever.@ All we did was play around and we were demolished at the state tournament.\
`ERIC: But did you enjoy yourself?\
`REBECCA: Yeah, but that's not the point.@ We're never going to turn into a competitive team in one year.@ There's no way you're going to earn any credit from being our captain.\
`ERIC: That's not...@ I don't intend...@ Never mind, just tell me if you'll come to the first meeting, at least.\

`REBECCA: Hey.\
`Maybe this kid will have some insight.\
`SID: Hello.\
`REBECCA: I don't think we've met.@ I'm Rebecca Bell.\
`SID: Sid Wallace.\

`SID: I thought you might know.@ You probably know him better than me.\

`SID: Maybe.@ But I don't think Eric is, at least not anymore.\
`REBECCA: What's that supposed to mean?\
`SID: I don't know.@ Just wait until the meeting, and we'll see if we can't figure it out.\
`REBECCA: What?\

`He's even more of a mystery than Eric.@ Fine.@ I'll keep my eye on him as well.@ It seems no matter how many people I know, there are always others with their own little mysteries.\

`MAX: Who's that guy?\
`REBECCA: One of Eric Larsen's friends, I guess.\
`I lose track of Sid in the throng of people by the hallway door.\
`REBECCA: Hey Max, are you coming to the fencing meeting?\
`MAX: I didn't know you could joke.\
`REBECCA: I'm perfectly capable of joking, but this time I'm not.@ For some reason Eric's decided to start it up again this year.\
`MAX: That madman probably thinks that if he makes us practice ten times a day then he can eke some credit out of us at the state tournament.\
`REBECCA: Then you're not coming?\
`MAX: I don't want to be some apple in a cider press, sitting there while Eric Larsen squeezes the life out of me.@ Can you imagine him turning the little cider crank with that goofy grin on his face?@ Drip, drip, drip.\
`REBECCA: Have I ever told you you're a nutjob?\
`MAX: Plenty of times, but you never seem to remember.\
`REBECCA: Just show up to the first meeting, then.@ Maybe he'll be like Emmanuel and just let us have fun with it.\
`MAX: Alright, I'm willing to be optimistic.@ I'll come.\
`REBECCA: Thanks, Max.\

`If Max shows up, that'll make four of us, counting Sid and Eric.@ We'll need at least two freshmen to join if we want to be counted as an official team.@ Maybe Eric's plan is to advertise so poorly that no one else shows up and he can honorably disband us returning members.@ But then why would he drag Sid into it?@ I don't understand.@ Last year he was so predictable that I had no trouble pegging him as the generic studying automaton.@ But it doesn't matter; I'll figure him out.@ Eventually, I figure everyone out.\

`MAX: You should probably leave.\
`ERIC: Yeah.\

`REBECCA: I can't tell if you approve or not.@ Stop mixing your sarcasm in with your praise.\
`MAX: Well, I'm sure Eric's just going to wheedle credit out of the good ol' fencing team, so I probably would've done the same thing.@ We need less captains like him.\

`Last year's captain, Emmanuel, failed half his classes, graduated with minimum credits, and could care less whether we won or lost.@ We were a pretty abysmal team.\
`REBECCA: There's no way he could reform us into a national level fencing group in three months.@ He'd have to be nuts.\
`MAX: You never know...\
`SID: I'm not so sure that's his plan.\
`MAX: Who are you, and how long have you been standing over my shoulder?\
`SID: I'm Sid Wallace.@ I'm joining fencing this year.\
`MAX: Aren't you spunky?@ Y'know, Eric's a big burly dude and he'll be pushing your nose to the grindstone.@ You'll be a fencing robot before you know it.\
`REBECCA: Better you than me, I guess.@ You do know who Eric Larsen is, right?\
`SID: We have a history class together, but no, I can't say I 'know' him in the sense that I know what he's thinking or planning.\
`MAX: Not everyone can be a mindreader like Rebecca.\
`SID: I'm just saying it might be worth it to take a chance and come to the meeting.@ Eric's different from Felix, Marisa, or those other seniors, not that I can explain it.\

`ERIC: Sorry.@ I'll go.\

`REBECCA: Fine, I'll go.@ But I still have no idea how Sid changed your mind...\

`REBECCA: She's not really uptight, just independent.@ Plus she doesn't appreciate when -\
`MAX: Why do you know everyone's psychological profile?\

`MAX: Watch out, Eric.@ She's had twice as long as you so I'm sure she knows all your little weaknesses now.@ Your run for valedictorian is over.\

`Those words might be more correct than he thinks.@ I wonder if Max is just joking around or Rebecca really did figure out what happened.@ There should be only one person who knows that.@ My thoughts are interrupted by a shuffling at the door.\

`LYRA: Lyra Cygnus.@ Can I ask what team this is?\

`MAX: Rebecca and I will be down at the gym.\

`At first I wonder why the track team members are all standing in place instead of jogging around the gym.@ Then I notice the windows.@ Through the glass panes at the top of the room, there is only a dusty white whirl.@ The lamps that light the way to the dorms are completely obscured.@ \

`CAIT: Is it snowing out there or is the wind just whipping it around?\
`LYRA: It's a blizzard.\

`LYRA: Are you going somewhere?\
`ERIC: I want to see the jazz rehearsal, but I'll be back in a few minutes.@ Stick with Rebecca and Max.\
`LYRA: No, I'll come with you.@ I'm sort of looking around for groups, and maybe jazz is for me.\

`We need three more, but I don't think Max justifies a response.@ I don't know him that well, but enough to know that his smile is just for show.\
`MAX: You have no soul.@ I know you probably wanted this club dissolved anyway, but this is just lame.\
`I want to respond, but I'm conditioned to catch myself.@ With those words, Max stands up, yawns, and pokes his head out into the hallway.\
`MAX: Yo!@ Whoever's interested in joining the world-famous St Magnus team for martial arts, swordplay, muscle-building, naturally-enhancing, free-credit-guaranteed team better get in here!\
`ERIC: Uh...\

`If I kill Max now, that's one less member recruited.@ Now there's even almost no chance that anyone out there will decide to join fencing.@ Then again, maybe that was always the case.@ Wasn't this supposed to be a haven for us abnormals anyway?@ I need to check myself before I revert into my old way of thinking.@ Before I have time to think of something to say to Max, someone walks through the door.\

`MAX: Hey, it worked!@ What's your name?\
`CAIT: I'm Caitlyn Baquiran.\
`MAX: I'm Maximilian Wolf.@ It's a real pleasure to welcome you to -@ \
`CAIT: If I shake your hand I'll catch your crazy.@ Now is this some kind of knife-fighting league?@ Karate team?@ Who's the real captain around here?\
`ERIC: Hi.@ I'm Eric, nice to meet you.@ We're the fencing team.\
`CAIT: Oh...@ Well, I guess that's almost like knife-fighting.@ I guess I'll join.\
`She pulls out a seat at the table but stops before sitting.\
`CAIT: There are two of you.@ That's an awkward date, not a team.\
`ERIC: Sid couldn't make it to the first meeting, and uh, we still need to recruit two more if we want to be an official team...\
`MAX: I can holler again.\
`CAIT: Sit down, will you?@ There are better recruitment strategies.\
`MAX: Where's she going?\
`ERIC: No idea.@ Do you know her?\
`MAX: Where's Rebecca when you need her...@ She knows every lunatic in this school.\
`I'm saved from responding by the return of Cait.\
`CAIT: Here.@ I've recruited another member.@ Tell them your name.\
`LYRA: Lyra Cygnus.@ Can I ask what team this is?\
`MAX: Cow-tipping.\
`CAIT: Shut up.@ This is the fencing team, and it's not polite to mislead people.\
`PETE: You're the one misleading people, haha.\
`CAIT: And who are you?\
`PETE: I'm Pete Sai.@ I'm joining the free-credit-guaranteed fencing team.\
`ERIC: Good, that's one more than we need to register as a team.@ I doubt anyone else is going to show up, so how about we start the meeting?\
`CAIT: Not before this kid apologizes.\
`PETE: You should apologize to Lyra then.@ You forced her to join for nothing.\
`LYRA: I'm fine.@ Fencing sounds interesting actually.\
`MAX: Don't feel like you have to stay.\
`CAIT: If she leaves then we have to disband.\
`LYRA: I told you I'm not leaving.\
`ERIC: Look, can we just start this meeting already?@ We've got two tournaments this year instead of only one last year, and -@ \
`I stop when Max starts glaring at me.\
`PETE: Hey, we should go down to the gym and check out the snow.\

`Here we are: my first choice as incompetent captain of the fencing club.@ Maybe I should stop thinking about how to run this team and step back a moment.@ I don't know how to control these people or even if I should be controlling them.@ Before I can make up my mind, Pete and Cait are both out the door.\

`CAIT: Where do you think you're going!?\
`LYRA: I should probably follow!\
`MAX: Congratulations, you just let all the new members escape.@ Should I find the nets?\
`ERIC: I'm horrible at this.@ How did we even end up with enough people?\
`MAX: Would you quit sulking around and act like the captain of this team?\
`ERIC: Yeah.@ Thanks for showing up.\
`MAX: Any time.@ Hey, I'll even do you another favor.@ If you want to sit here and gather your thoughts for a minute, I'll go down to the gym and make sure they don't kill each other.\
`ERIC: Thanks.@ I'd appreciate it.\

`I have to wonder why Max is putting in such an effort, but maybe he just enjoyed fencing last year and wants to continue.@ In any case, this gives me the chance to check\
`on Sid back at the auditorium.@ With any luck, the jazz band will be done practicing for the day and he can come to the first practice.\

`As I walk down the main hall, I keep glancing over my shoulder at the window at the end of the hallway.@ There's something not quite right.@ In the winter, the darkness through the windows only serve to remind us of the neverending night, but this afternoon the black is tinted with gray snow.@ I can't tell if there's a storm outside or if the wind is just picking up what's already on the ground.@ When I face front again, I almost walk into Rebecca.\

`REBECCA: Oh.\
`ERIC: Sorry, I was looking at the snow.\
`REBECCA: Have you seen Max around?\
`ERIC: He should be at the gym.@ He's keeping track of the freshmen while I find Sid.\
`REBECCA: And I thought Max was kidding about that...\
`ERIC: You won't consider joining again?\
`REBECCA: Look Eric, what's this about?@ You're a senior.@ You're a smart senior.@ Why are you wasting your time on us?@ There's no credit in the fencing team.\
`ERIC: I don't care about credit any more.\
`I'm not lying.\
`REBECCA: No way.@ What did you spend the past three years doing?@ Were those all a joke?\
`ERIC: Something happened.@ I don't think like that now.\
`REBECCA: Something happened?@ That's the best you can come up with?\
`ERIC: I'd rather not go into it right now.@ Maybe I'll tell you later, if you join.\
`REBECCA: It's not going to work.\
`ERIC: Why do you need to know if I'm planning something?@ I just want to run the fencing team the exact same way as last year.@ If I do all the right actions, what does it matter what I'm thinking?\
`She sighs.\
`REBECCA: That's just the way I am, Eric.@ Sorry.\
`ERIC: It's alright.@ We found enough members anyway.\
`REBECCA: I'll go.\
`ERIC: Really?\
`REBECCA: Yeah.@ You owe me one.\
`ERIC: Thanks.@ See you in a few minutes, then.\

`That was lucky.@ I'm not sure how else to explain it.@ Maybe we do stand a chance of being the old fencing team after all.@ When she turns down the gym hallway, I continue along the main hall.\

`REBECCA: You're right.@ I'll come with you.\

`That doesn't even warrant a response.\

`We exit the gym, almost tripping over Kenneth's guard.@ Luckily the walk to the pool is short.@ Max and I both sit down outside the door.@ Even though there's a window, it's impossible to see anything through it.\
