Quick notes on choices in Snowbound -- nothing much affects the plot or endings
and usual decisions just get exposition on one character versus another, so feel
free to just pick whatever and reload from saves if something unfortunate
happens. A few meaningful choices are listed here just to make beta reading more
convenient. Feel free to ignore if you prefer to play without advance knowledge.

Choices that trigger bad end 1:
 - Refusing to work with Felix on day 3

Choices that trigger bad end 2:
 - Postponing hallway exploration on day 3
 - Sticking up for Cait on day 3
 
Choices that trigger bad end 3 (this is actually an entirely separate arc):
 - Accept Felix's offer on day 7

Apart from that, there are three endings at the er end of the script that are
mostly interchangeable, one of which requires making at least one Eric-positive
decision as Rebecca way back on day 1. It's probably not worth playing towards.
